      "Experience:April 2013  Present: Microsoft Corp. Redmond, WAData ScientistDr. Anyouzoa is the lead Data Scientist in a company wide effort to use telemetry as tests. The solution relies upon an Analyzers Framework fed by multiple event based systems. Dr. Anyouzoa designed the framework and is actively involved in its implementation. The main requirements were to build a system that will be up 24/7, permit seamless extension and live maintenance (e.g.: the framework should never be brought down for patches). This framework lets individuals across the company add new functionalities to it through the implementation of extensible interfaces (custom analyzers) and dynamic linking. The results of the custom analyzers are routed to the scoring engine mentioned below for advanced statistical analysis. This framework provides engineers with tools to measure the confidence and reliability in data. It is a surface that bridges the gap between the raw data Microsoft collects from billions of machines worldwide and advanced mathematics needed to derive insights from that data. The goal is to enable engineers to leverage advanced and matured mathematics from fields like Information theory, Evolutionary dynamics, etc., without having to deal with the complexity of the required science.As owner of Windows Telemetry Quality. Dr. Anyouzoa role is to extract wisdom from data. Skills required combine those of an engineer, statistician, artist and scientist to extract the nuggets of gold hidden under mountains of data, ultimately steering innovation through information. Another part of his role is to teach and encourage others to learn new ways to look at data, and push the envelope to help Microsoft get and keep a competitive edge in data science.Dr. Anyouzoa authored a policy paper for Microsoft executive (VP level) titled: Data Scientists - What does the mold look like? The goal was to provide the executive with guidelines as to where and how to invest in data science related areas to help Microsoft catch up with the competition, and lead the game in this new and promising field.Dr. Anyouzoa authored a state of the Windows Ecosystem document for Microsoft executive (VP level) titled: Data Driven Engineering at Work Restoring the Windows Eco-Immune System? A 66 pages diagnostic document summarizing the ills of the Windows Ecosystem and a proposing the remedies to fix it.Dr. Anyouzoa authored a future of quality paper for Microsoft executives (VP level) titled: The Search for Continuous Quality. This two pages document argues that, if quality is a search problem, then quality is a process and should therefore be treated as a continuous process. This paper outlines the mindset and examples of workflows that are more likely to sustain continuous quality at Microsoft.Dr. Anyouzoa is currently working on an automatic patterns discovery tool that extends the scoring engine technology he created, to analyze large-scale temporal data matrices with billions of entries, using techniques from hyper-spectral imaging. The goal here is to detect pre-symptomatic stress in customers' behaviors.Sept-2012  April-2013: Microsoft Corp. Redmond, WAPerformance Analyst  Performance Program Manager for Windows Sustained EngineeringThis role is to prevent the Windows Operating System from regressing through Windows updates. In this position, Dr. Anyouzoa analyzes Windows Scorecards and makes recommendations on to be released monthly windows updates based on the problems found during the performance Monthly Test Pass (MTP). Dr. Anyouzoa sits in the War Room to make sure that recommendations made from the scorecards analysis are strictly followed. May-2008  April-2013: Microsoft Corp. Redmond, WAPerformance AnalystDr. Anyouzoa is a Performance Analyst and Engineer working on researching means to enhance the overall responsiveness of the Windows operating systems through structured experimental design and analysis using mathematical methods. His responsibilities go as far as to diagnose performance issues in components brought to his attention, and propose fixes that can involve redesigning components to meet specific performance requirements.Dr. Anyouzoa has designed and implemented a scoring engine to guard the Windows OS against regressions, using Tensors Physics and techniques from Neuroscience. The scoring engine is at the heart of monitoring code flow to prevent code churn from regressing the Windows OS, ultimately preventing such regressions to land into a customers computers. A key pillar for shipping a cleaner, leaner and faster Windows.Dr. Anyouzoa is in charge of all the mathematics used in the Scoring Engine. This role involves validating all mathematics underlying the design of components used in the scoring engine and other analysis tools used by performance analysts; proposes innovative solutions to protect an ever-evolving OS.Dr. Anyouzoa has designed and implemented an entropy-based variability allocation system that, in face of variability in systems (machines, code-flows) response, would detect the source of variability in the data stream (machines, code-flow, combination machine\\code-flow or other factors).Dr. Anyouzoa has designed and implemented a C++ based test framework that replaced a Jscript based test framework used to test Windows servers.Dr. Anyouzoa has designed and implemented a Memory Analysis Tool based on Xperf, SQL Server, and SQL Analysis Services to correlate the frequency of appearance of COW (Copy On Write) pages and different kind of page faults. Feb-2007  May 2008: Global InfoTek, Inc.  Reston, VAPrincipal Scientist(Global InfoTek, Inc. (GITI) is an advanced technology integration development company). At GITI, Dr. Alain Anyouzoa has contributed to GITIs Intelligent Service Layer (ISL) and Composable Heterogeneous Agents for Intelligent notification (CHAIN) projects. CHAIN is an agent based workflow management system. Dr. Anyouzoa was the Principal Investigator for the CERDEC (Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center) sponsored Distributed Battle Command Tracking System (DBCTS), a multi-agent based system that tracks the movement of friendly and enemy units in a combat zone. The DBCTS is an agent agnostic platform system where Cougaar, Jade, EMAA, i-Globe agent coexist seamlessly. Dr. Anyouzoa prepared and co-designs defense-related SBIR and BAA proposals, including the Deep Green BAA; Dr. Anyouzoa was member of the GITIs Deep Green Team, a program sponsored by DARPA. Deep Green consisted of a variety of software that battlefield commanders can feed information into and get feedback forecasts of how a mission might turn out in return. At the center of the system were two pieces of software: \"Blitzkrieg,\" which produces combat models for commanders to consider, and \"Crystal Ball,\" which pools a variety of information and offers up the most likely scenarios and the best course of action. Dr. Anyouzoa was also the Chief Architect on a CERDEC-C2D sponsored Agent Development Toolkit, a phase II SBIR and Eclipses inspired system where developers will be able to put together societies of intelligent agents, test them and deliver them remotely to warfighters on the battlefield.  Feb-2005  Feb-2007: Cougaar Software, Inc.  McLean, VASenior Software EngineerDr. Anyouzoa was the lead architect of the Health Grid Initiative, a portal to validate the credentials of physicians, in an authoritative and secure fashion where users must be validated by one of the recognized identity providers, before being allowed to use the system. The Health Grid Initiative was a U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command funded project. Dr. Anyouzoa worked on updating the UltraLog (a supply chain management system for the US military) capability into ActiveMethods and ActiveEdge platform constructs as well as modernizing the core technology, Cougaar used in UltraLog.   Specifically, Dr. Anyouzoa designed and developed the improvements of the Cougaar Configuration Mgt (CCM) System to support this project.   Dr. Anyouzoa designed and implemented a framework for the Free Flight Initiative, which is an FAA-LMI sponsored project.
