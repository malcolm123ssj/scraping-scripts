Residents fear a bigger mess in the event of rains, which are likely to fall anytime soon.Around 415 trees, 1,381 branches and many electric poles were uprooted due to heavy rain and wind last week in areas like Hanumanthnagar, Srinagar, Hoskerehalli and Raja Rajeshwari Nagar. Though the civic bodies acted swiftly and cleared the paths, it is yet to shift fallen trees and branches.“The fallen trees and branches are turning hotspots for snakes and insects. We feel scared to walk by these fallen trees and branches. They are also blocking drains. If it rains anytime soon, then there will be water-logging,” Savitha, a resident of Raja Rajeshwari Nagar told DH.There are many areas where the BBMP has still not cleared the fallen trees. Vishwanath, a resident of Hanumanthnagar said, “When we ask BBMP to clear the mess, officials say they are short of men and machines. Trees have not been cleared even a week after they were uprooted and they are causing a stench in the locality.”When the BBMP forest cell was asked about the situation, they denied there was any shortage of staff or vehicles for the woek.“The situation is because of the unexpected rain. We did not expect it to create so much havoc in the city. We have a team to address these issues. I have also deputed engineers from other zones to clear the mess.

It also regulated the use of antibiotics only for therapeutic use and under the supervision of a veterinarian, and called for regular inspection of poultry farms by authorised personnel who should follow proper bio-security protocols.The poultry sector has been given five years to switch over to new systems.“The parameters recommended regarding space requirement, behavioural needs and other welfare concerns are based on studies conducted in the European Union nations, which are not relevant to India. NGOs which have lobbied for a ban of cages have painted a wrong picture of the poultry sector.Healthy birds mean healthy business for poultry farmers and they have been continuously improving practices in farms to maintain hygiene and other conditions. Bird losses for a farmer mean loss of livelihood,” said Deve Gowda, vice-president of the World Poultry Science Association (India Branch).\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The morbid obesity of a 71-year-old retired man has put the spotlight on a growing epidemic of unhealthy weight-gain, a common feature among India’s adults.The man, an Indian national residing in the United States, has been referred to Manipal Hospitals for a knee replacement surgery, after another hospital had refused to treat him due to concerns of medical complications.Dr Lokesh Veerappa, a joint replacement surgeon designated as the treating physician, identified a larger lifestyle flaw as the bedridden patient used a CPAP breathing machine to compensate for his respiratory problems.“His obesity was at the root of all his (health) problems,” Dr Veerappa said. “He stopped walking, which led to the worsening of his health, and was the onset of depression.”\\xa0The combination of knee osteoarthritis and morbid obesity traps patients in a vicious cycle of bad health and lack of exercise, Dr Veerappa explained, as the knees suffer early damage and prevent the patient from exercising and losing weight.Dr Veerappa said the patient regained mobility following the successful knee replacement and lost several kilos of weight.A study by the Indian Council of Medical Research–India Diabetes noted how the country’s growing affluence is transforming the health issues faced by citizens. “Under-nutrition due to poverty, which dominated in the past, is being rapidly replaced by obesity associated with affluence, resulting in an estimated 88 million individuals in the country who are overweight,” it said.The study also said 135 million individuals have generalised obesity, 153 million with abdominal obesity and 107 million with combined obesity.City-based endocrinologist Dr A Sharda said the trend that afflicts all age groups reflects the changing nature of the Indian dietary preferences. The shrinking public space for exercise and recreation is a factor in the growing sedentary lifestyle of people, she added. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

He has decided to quit and will not contest in next election scheduled in September.Karnataka Jain Association has 8,000 registered members in Bengaluru alone and also has branch offices at all the districts of the state. So far, the association has seen only 12 presidents.The association had become dysfunctional for a few years in Mysuru due to lack of effective leadership in the early 60s. Later, the Jain community in Bengaluru took charge of the Mysore-based association and established it on KR Road in Basavangudi, Bengaluru by providing hostels, halls and a temple for people of the community.During the valedictory function of the centenary celebrations, a book talking about the journey of the society will be released.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday A government school in Victoria Layout, Yalagonda Palya, in the\\xa0news recently for turning pale with an abrupt whitewash, has gained back its beauty.Volunteers who transformed the school with their wonderful art works in January saw the Election Commission whitewashing the walls on account of the model code of conduct, though the paintings did not have any political significance.The same group of volunteers turned up at the school on June 5 and painted it back to its vibrancy. Marking World Environment Day, the volunteers also planted saplings at the school premises along with the city police commissioner. The saplings planted were named after Kannada poets.Local residents and school students also joined hands with the volunteers from the Shilpa Foundation and Fedilitus Art Gallery, who beautified the school as part of their CSR initiative.“We painted the walls with new art works. Now, it sports flowers, pencil, plants and butterflies, among other things,” Achyuth Gowda, founder, Fedilitus Corp, told\\xa0DH.He said the volunteers think it their duty to beautify the school once again. “This was like a welcome event for the students who are starting a new academic year,” Gowda said.The company spent\\xa0Rs 20,000 on the initiative.On whether\\xa0the volunteers had asked the EC the reason behind whitewashing the school, Gowda said: “Let’s not blame anyone here. The officials have only done their duty. We waited for the school to reopen and now we found the right time to (re-beautify) it.”\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

Each year, the hospital sees about 1,000 burns victims. According to the doctors, to treat one severe burns victim, skin from three donors is needed.To create awareness about skin donation, the Rotary Bangalore Midtown, in association with Prestige Group and Ashirvad Pipes, has organised a 5 km walkathon on June 9 from St. Joseph’s Indian High School ground at 6.30 am.One of India’s bravehearts, Laxmi Agarwal, an acid attack survivor, will participate.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Every summer, water, or rather the lack of it, always becomes the topic of concern in Bengaluru. Recently, 670 Bengalureans signed a petition launched by the Bangalore Apartments’ Federation (BAF) to conserve water through various measures, keeping in mind the current water crisis the city is currently facing. This petition was for the citizens as opposed to the usual address to the authorities.DH had earlier reported that BAF, which represents over 70,000 apartments, had also conducted the BAFHalfBucketChallenge, a social media campaign urging its members to bathe in half a bucket of water to tackle the issue of water shortage. Their objective is to generate consciousness about water preservation among citizens.In this petition, the residents are provided with certain suggestions which could prove to be beneficial considering that Bengaluru is in the throes of a water crisis with erratic supply of Cauvery water and groundwater running dry in several places. Suggestions included installations of smart water meters, installation of tap aerators in taps, simple but effective measures like checking taps and faucets for leaks, using washing machines with only full load, cleaning vehicles without water, collecting RO waste water for household cleaning and so on.There have been initiatives taken up by various citizen-based associations and organisations to collectively come up with solutions for this problem which holds long-term implications.ADDA, a company that offers an integrated apartment management software for gated communities, organised a water workshop, a third of its kind to find solutions to the water crisis. It brought to light several ongoing sustainable water management measures.With a focus on gated communities, representatives of Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs), citizen groups and activists met on March 23, at the The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) campus, Domlur, to seek solutions to the ongoing water crisis- monitoring of water consumption in apartment complexes, avoiding the usage of showers while bathing and working with Ward Committees to ensure proper drainage system to name a few. Improvement in utilisation of existing rainwater harvesting programmes and digging of wells to recharge groundwater are essential steps to be implemented.Whitefield Rising (WFR) is a civic group which has regularly made conscious and sustained efforts to rejuvenate lakes in Whitefield and to organise workshops on water management. Their emphasis has been on the need to reuse water and to set up Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) in the area. STP-treated water can be used in gardens and car washing and dual piping installation can help in using the treated water for toilet flushing.The theory of ‘Ecowaternomics’ is widely discussed by almost every association aiming to make the situation better for future generations. It looks at the economics of using less water from two angles – using less and reusing more.True to its identity as a tech and start-up hub, Bengaluru has had innovations that could go a long way in tackling the issue at hand. Biome Environmental Solutions is another Bengaluru-based design firm having an expertise in providing knowledge services water management and rainwater harvesting, ecological wastewater treatment and sanitation practices, highlights limiting citizens’ demand for water since relying on the supply side was not a sustainable solution.SmarterHomes by Vivek Shukla (helps users track water usage), OpenWater.In by Sanjiv Sambadan, IISc professor (converts waste water to potable water) and the like have opened up new doors.Importance of individual contributions towards saving water cannot be overlooked. Furthermore, there is a need to engage knowledge partners, authorities and citizens in conversation to bring about real change and prevent the water issue from spiraling out, beyond our control.

They are persuading the underprivileged to switch to eco-friendly practices. The informal bunch are school students from Bengaluru.Their goal? Every woman should be able to manage menstruation in a hygienic and dignified way.Led by a\\xa0grade 12 science student, the team calls itself RutuChakra. Sanjana Dixit from the National Public School formed the group in January 2018.Having conducted multiple workshops and awareness programmes, RutuChakra has managed to raise Rs 4.5 lakh through crowdfunding.It all began when Sanjana visited an orphanage early last year and used a washroom there.\"I started questioning the awareness level among underprivileged girls. I was wondering if they knew what safe menstruation meant,\" she said.Availability was a question, Sanjana observed. \"When I spoke to the person in charge there, I understood that many donate stationery and clothes. None gave money or donated supplies when it came to menstruation,\" she added.Sanjana\\xa0believes, along with safety, sustainability is an important factor. As RutuChakra reaches out to women under 18, they are educated about sanitary napkins and are supplied reusable sanitary pads. However, for those above 18, options such as menstrual cups are recommended.RutuChakra has supported over 550 girls and women, distributed 33,000 sanitary napkins and conducted over 11 workshops so far.Sanjana said she was waiting to turn 18 so that she could have her NGO registered. \"For now, I have a team that is passionate -- school students from\\xa0various backgrounds,\" she said.Sanjana hopes to pursue a career in either molecular biology or biotechnology.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

We are also setting up a warehouse where the mangoes can be stocked and distributed.”For orders as minimal as three kilos, the postmen of the respective areas will do the doorstep delivery while the bigger consignments will be delivered by vehicles that are already catering to e-commerce websites.Special packaging instructions have been given to farmers to ensure that the fruits are packed well in cartons which have no punch holes like in the usual cases where the product is distributed.“The mangoes have to be ripe to sustain a transit time of 6-7 days. However, arrangements will be made for delivery within one or two days,” an official communication by the postal department reads.The Mango Development Board has launched a website which hosts the details of farmers and the varieties of mangoes cultivated. It also has details about the location where they are grown. Customers can place their orders online.C G Nagaraju, managing director, Mango Development Board, said that previously the board had orders from 96 customers, most of which have been cleared. “We had challenges finding the postal code and address. Having thought about the possible solutions, we approached the GPO and they consented. We have on board 15 farmers who are certified to have good agricultural practices. This is being done on a trial basis here and will be expanded across the state,” he said.\\xa0Farmers are expected to deliver mangoes to the warehouse before dawn from where the dispatch will happen. Packaging, ensuring the address is mentioned and the liberty of fixing prices have been given to the farmers.Orders can be placed on karsirimangoes.karnataka.gov.in.

       "  \"Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Compared to five years ago, there is less stigma attached to the LGBTQIA+ community today, says 70% of community members surveyed by online dating App, Tinder.\\xa0This fresh insight into how the community feels about love, dating and friendships followed Tinder's foray into multi-gender relationships late last year.\\xa0Probing deeper, the survey got the community talking about identity, public display of affection (PDA) and more. In an interesting revelation, the survey found that 61% had identified themselves as LGBTQIA+ on an online platform or closed group prior to formally coming out to friends/family.A Tinder statement explained why it surveyed LGBTQIA+ community members: To understand India’s shifting cultural paradigm, their attitude towards dating and dating culture, how dating apps are empowering authentic identities and helping erode stigma.Here's another insight from the survey: LGBTQIA+ are comfortable with PDA on a date when it comes to hugging (60%), holding hands (62%) or kissing (44%). But a high 70% want their date to be involved in issues that the community faces.\\xa0Increased normalisation of different sexual orientations has made it easier for members of the LGBTQIA+ community to be open and honest about their dating lives (30%). This is particularly true for Tinder users (38% compared to 17% of non-dating app/site users), the survey notes.More than a quarter of LGBTQIA+ people (30%) say the pressure to be in a relationship has lessened in the last five years. One in five say they are less ashamed of their single status than they were five years ago\\xa0The top three issues amongst LGBTQIA+ community, the survey found, are religious freedom (38%), workplace inequality (32%) and youth homelessness (32%).\\xa0The research findings were based on a survey conducted across India between March 19 and April 18. As many as 500 respondents were asked general questions to explore their attitudes around their LGBTQ+ identity as it pertains to dating and dating culture. The study targeted consumers between the ages of 18-45 years old who identify as LGBTQ+.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Questions over safety of travelling in Uber cabs came to the fore once again after a Uber driver left a family in the middle of the road for declining to utilise his service outside the ambit of the app. The cab aggregator is receiving brickbats online for the “callousness”.Rishi Bhatia, travelling with his wife and three-year-old child, booked a cab at 10 pm on Sunday night from Kempegowda International Airport. After starting the journey, the driver told the couple to cancel the trip and ride outside Uber’s network, which will save him the commission paid to Uber, which is 25% of the fare.The couple declined. “Since we were near the airport, we asked him to drop us (at airport) so we can get another cab. But he was not ready to do that either. He switched off the AC, locked the windows and doors. We felt really unsafe,” Neha Sehgal Bhatia, Rishi’s wife, wrote in a Facebook post, which went viral.The couple then called the police (100) and some security guards passing by for help to reach the airport. “(As) the security of the airport intervened, he (driver) just ran away, dropping our luggage in the middle of the road (sic),” she said.In between, they called Uber helpline. The recorded conversation shows that Uber will not offer any help in such circumstances. In the eight-minute conversation, the helpless executive at customer care says he can’t do anything other than advising the passenger to call the police.Repeated incidentsIn December 2018, DH contacted Uber several times over the recent trend of drivers urging customers to cancel the rides and travel off the Uber app. In one incident, a customer travelling to the airport was stranded on road.The cab arrived but the driver insisted that the customer cancel the Uber booking. “The driver offered that I can pay Rs 100 less than the amount shown in the app. But we did not want to take the cab owing to lack of safety,” said Aradhya (name changed).Responding to Neha’s post, Uber released a statement: “We regret the inconvenience caused to the rider. This form of misconduct by a driver partner violates our community guidelines. We are investigating this matter and will take necessary actions, as needed. Safety is paramount to Uber and we are deeply committed to it.”However, Neha noted that Uber never contacted her after the incident to enquire about her safety. Several individuals expressed shock and shared similar experiences online.Commenting on Neha’s status, many shared similar experiences with Uber and urged her to take action. “This is very common with Uber. You may file a case against Uber, since it’s their deficiency in service. They are liable for your safety,” John Deep Pandian wrote on Facebook. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The state government called on the public to report overcharging by hospitals and said it will look into enhancing protection of patients in the wake of a Deccan Herald\\xa0news report on April 25, detailing the death of a Nigerian national at Manipal Hospitals.Speaking to DH, principal secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, Jawaid Akhtar said that a provision exists within the Karnataka Private Medical Establishments (KPME) Act, allowing the public to report any hospital, dispensary or clinic that charges more\\xa0than the established rate for services and care.“Public must file complaints with the health and family welfare commissioner, who is the chairman of the expert committee.\\xa0An inquiry will be conducted and action will be taken,” he said and suggested that Tobi Ajisegbede of Lagos, Nigeria, who lost his mother, Juliet, at Manipal Hospitals on April 14, should write to the commissioner, asking him to initiate an inquiry.Activists and lawyers pointed out that while the KPME Act can address matters of financial abuse, it offers little in the way of offering succour to victims of negligence.Vijayakumar Seetappa of the medical watchdog, Karnataka Janaarogya Chaluvali, said a few Indian victims of negligence are able to get justice, much less than the thousands of foreign visitors who come for medical care.“There is no mechanism for redressal at all because medical care in India exists in a regulatory vacuum,” Seetappa said.City-based lawyer Taji George, who holds the same view, provided evidence of several cases of negligence by hospitals. “About 10% of all medical failures are a result of negligence and most of the victims are foreigners,” George said. “And, what is the government doing? Nothing.”Though the government mandates treatment rates, George said that a few hospitals display figures right, leading to exorbitant\\xa0charges\\xa0for treatment.With increasing cases of negligence, Akhtar said the government will strengthen regulations. “We are planning to appraise and train our people to be more vigilant,” he said. However, the system will only work if the public files complaints with the committee, the principal secretary added.\\xa0A recap of the caseTobi Ajisegbede from Lagos,\\xa0Nigeria, who lost his\\xa058-year-old mother at Manipal\\xa0Hospitals on April\\xa014, alleged medical negligence of the hospital staff, and a pattern of extortion by the administration.\\xa0For $10,000 (Rs\\xa06,98,000), the hospital\\xa0offered quick and effective\\xa0results to Ajisegbede’s\\xa0mother who was suffering\\xa0from Lumbar Canal Stenosis (narrowing of the\\xa0spinal canal, compressing\\xa0the nerves).

Following the orders, the churches have streamlined the entry and exit of devotees and general public for masses on Sunday.Separate gatesSt Mark’s Cathedral in the heart of Bengaluru has sent out messages to its congregational members about the security measures. “Three gates have been created for the entry and exit of people. All members have been issued stickers for their vehicles....,” a message said. At some prominent churches, the city police have deployed forces to keep a tab on the movement of public.The churches have appealed to devotees not to bring any metal objects. Frisking will be done if necessary. Cabs and autos have been banned from entering the premises. Backpacks and large bags are also banned inside the churches. A few churches have also formed volunteer groups to keep a vigil during service hours.A Presbyter with a prominent church in CBD area told DH that besides the Divine Mercy Sunday mass, special services and prayers are being organised in memory of those who died in Lanka blasts.A senior police officer attached with the Central Division told DH that they have visited a couple of churches and analysed the security arrangements. “We have directed all churches to install CCTV cameras at all vantage positions. We have tested them for quality of pictures,” he said.As the Sunday service will draw thousands of devotees, police personnel will constantly patrol those areas.The police have also asked community members to employ private security guards for frisking and checking vehicles and baggage.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The high court on Friday ordered the immediate deportation of a Pakistani couple convicted for illegally staying in India.It directed the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Foreigners Regional Registration Office to initiate necessary steps to complete the process of deporting Kashif Shamsuddin and Kiran Ghulam Ali before May 5.Hearing the petitions filed by the couple who hail from Chakraphot in Karachi district of Pakistan, Justice Aravind Kumar ordered: “There shall not be any delay in their deportation. The couple must immediately be taken to the Wagah border and deported to Pakistan.”Even though Additional Solicitor General Prabhuling K Navadgi requested the court to grant a few days’ time as they have been waiting for confirmation from the Pakistan High Commission about the couple’s background, the court refused the request.The judge said allowing the couple to stay either in jail or outside would not only be a burden on the state’s exchequer but also amount to putting a premium on their illegal stay.Sources said the couple had been living in Bengaluru at a rented house in Kumaraswamy Layout since 2016, had obtained an Aadhaar card and were working at a local firm. They were identified by the Kumaraswamy Layout and Banashankari police and booked under the IPC as well as the Foreigners Act and the Passports Act. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Even before the highly anticipated Avengers: Endgame hit the screens on April 26, it had broken the record for the highest-ever advance ticket sales for a Hollywood film so far on the online portal, BookMyShow.With 18 tickets sold per second, the total recorded sale was a whopping 2.5 million. But thousands struggled to arrange tickets for the weekend or on the release day.Sources said the tickets transferred hands with jacked up prices in black with fans, eager to watch the first day’s show, voicing no protest. Marvel brought their decade-long series to an end with the final sequel, Endgame, and fans were ecstatic about it.So unprecedented are the hype and frenzy around this movie that the law has made an exception and allowed multiplexes to screen it round-the-clock, giving loyal fans a chance to watch the early show.Shaun Joe, a student of Christ University, was eagerly awaited the 6 am first day, first show. “It was one of the best culmination of MCU movies.

Their reactions reveal that this movie has surely exceeded every Marvelite’s expectations.“It’s the end of an amazing journey, the ultimatum to all the evil. It, kind of, turned out to be one of the greatest treats to anyone who has been following Marvel throughout,” said Abhishek Chowdhary, a student of CMS.The movie has emerged as a must-watch across the city, with theatres running packed shows.“The movie was a perfect blend, where the characters had reclassified introduction. The fight scenes were jaw-dropping, along with an on-point storyline and cinematography. This is the sole reason why I would recommend more people to watch it,” claimed Shree Krishnadeva, a Marvel fan for over 10 years. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday While freedom of the press is important, media personnel should follow a set of principles, Sanjoy Hazarika, Director of Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), said.Speaking about ‘Rights of Media: Increasing pressure on free media’ on Thursday, he said four journalists had been killed in the past four years. While some were shot dead, others were kidnapped and killed.Calling the deceased journalists martyrs he said they were exercising their duty under Article 19 that ensures freedom of expression.India ranks 140 of the 180 countries listed in the World Press Freedom Index. The top two countries are Norway and Finland while India is ranked lower than the UAE and\\nJamaica.Hazarika pointed out that most organisations have human rights policies for salaries and leave. But they should have one for internal governance and women’s security also. Due to the lack of safety in workspaces, there is a drop in the number of working women over the past 10 years.Similarly, there should also be an external policy for coverage. Apart from knowing what to cover and not, it is important to know how to cover an issue, he said adding that the civil society should look at media as its partner in disseminating information and not as its consumer.Instead of covering news, media men are becoming the news. Truth is a powerful tool and media should be clear on it. The media has a duty to reflect facts in all diversity. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

The nocturnal animals were once a common feature in the city’s prime lung space where they have not been sighted for the past two years.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday When his mother was diagnosed with diabetes in 2017, Arka Pudota did what every 15-year-old would do: scour the internet for healthier recipes.\\xa0Barring a few conventional millet-based dishes, there was not much of anything. Not the one to give up, Pudota experimented with conventional recipes and came up with much tastier dishes, which he began sharing on his YouTube channel ‘Millet Mantra’. Now he is a rising star among the city YouTubers.\\xa0Be it Jowar Methi balls, Foxtail millet coconut rice, Ragi/Finger Millet Vermicelli Upma or Ragi Paneer Paniyaram, Pudota blends the mouthwatering effect of the dishes with the nutritious value to educate his 2,000 YouTube subscribers and 7,000 Facebook followers.\\xa0The channel is also turning out to be one of the best sources on millet varieties and their health benefits. “I’ve got feedback on how my channel helped people. Some shared their most interesting recipes, while a few reached out to learn more about millets,” the teenager said.\\xa0His brother Arya’s channel on organic farming was an additional impetus to choose YouTube. “His videos sensitised me to problems of the farmers who see no demand for millets. I encourage people to make millet a part of their diet and create a demand,” Pudota said.“Smaller portions of millet dishes make you full. That’s why they’re great substitutes for rice, which we need to eat more to feel satiated. Millets are also more nutritious,” said the teen. Millets also benefit farmers as they are not water-intensive and are best suited for arid regions.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Some polling booths in Bengaluru were inaccessible for voters with disability and seniors.Elderly voters were made to walk up 2-3 floors to cast their votes and the ramps set up proved to be inadequate.At the Government Primary School behind Hoskerehalli bus stand, a bunch of scouts carried the wheelchair-bound elders and people with disability to the second-floor polling station. Voters relied on the 10 or 15 scouts since the ramp set up here was uneven.“We’re doing our bit for the nation. We’re still not eligible to vote and the least we could do is to assist the voters. We noticed the plight of the voters last time and decided to help,” Sanjeev, a member of the scout team, told DH.Some voters were furious that the EC did not set up the facilities properly to allow them to reach the booth unaided. Nagaraj Nayak (89) made no secret of his feelings. “Polling booths should be on the ground floor and should be easily accessible. We’re thankful to these kids, but the EC should take notice and correct this next time,” he said. \\xa0The scene was no different at another booth in Uttarahalli, where the NCC cadets carried the elders and those with disability.The government school in Vasanthpur had the polling station on the first floor, making it difficult for the seniors to reach.Paralysed man carried to polling boothA 52-year-old paralysed man did not allow his challenge to stop him from exercising his democratic right on Thursday.Ajaz Ahmed, who suffers from a host of health issues that includes kidney problems, diabetes and blood pressure was carried to a polling booth to vote by his family members to cast his vote.Speaking about his commitment to vote, Aejaz Baig, Ahmed\\'s brother-in-law says \" He got up early in the morning and was geared up to cast his vote . He kept pushing us to take him to the voting booth. He has never stepped back from voting as he believes that one must vote without fail as a proud citizen of India.\"He also adds that Ahmed\\'s failing health has never stopped him from performing his duties and he is an inspiration to his family.On Thursday Ahmed arrived in an auto from which he was carried by four of his family members to a polling booth in Chikkabasavanapura in K R puram constituency to cast his vote.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Even if you have never touched alcohol, you can still get liver cirrhosis.\\xa0A new study in the UK has found that a large number of teenagers and young adults have Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver (NAFL).\\xa0A Bengaluru-based gastroenterologist sees five patients in the 16-20 age group with NAFL in a month, underscoring the prevalence of the condition closer home. \"Eating junk food, cheese, drinking carbonated drinks and not exercising much cause NAFL in the long run,\" said Dr M S Sandeep, a gastroenterologist at Apollo Hospitals.\\xa0According to him, the profile of people with fatty liver has changed from alcoholics to consumers of processed food in the last five years. The liver bears lots of abuse and allows the patient to lead a normal life until it is 70% damaged.\"It takes decades for someone to develop the liver disease,\" Dr Sandeep said. \"When it\\'s diagnosed, a lot of time is lost. Though there\\xa0are medication and lifestyle changes, you can\\'t actually cure fatty liver.\"\\xa0Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is the result of fat build-up in the liver and is more serious among fatty liver diseases.\\xa0If you have NASH, you have inflammation and liver cell damage, along with fat in your liver.\\xa0Surprisingly, women in their late teens and early 20s are developing liver cirrhosis. Autoimmune hepatitis, for instance, is more common among women than men and can begin at a very young age. It may cause abdominal pain, jaundice, fatigue, weight loss and disabling joint pain. If left untreated or undiagnosed, autoimmune hepatitis can develop into cirrhosis. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Though treatment for haemophilia is free of cost at government hospitals in Karnataka, just 20% of individuals suffering from the condition have access to it.\\xa0According to Vikash Goel, president, Hemophilia Federation (India), a large population\\xa0is still undiagnosed, leading to complications and untimely deaths. \"Even the medical fraternity is not aware of haemophilia and its diagnosis, especially in rural areas,\" adds Goel.\\xa0In Karnataka, the treatment for haemophilia was regularised in 2017. About 2,645 patients are treated free of charge in government hospitals at a cost of Rs 15 crore per year. Dr Swatantra Banakar, deputy director, blood safety, Health and Family Welfare Service, says the number of patients\\xa0is increasing every year. \"The treatment is for life where blood factors are given in the form of injections. The drugs are mainly imported, procured through tenders,\"\\xa0he adds.\\xa0According to\\xa0Dr Cecil Ross, a haematologist at St John\\'s hospital, early diagnosis and access to treatment\\xa0are giving children a near normal childhood. \"Proper physiotherapy plays an important part in ensuring that they remain active and healthy. The current standard is to treat all children with regular replacement therapy\\xa0— prophylactic infusions of clotting factor concentrates to prevent bleeding,\" he says.There is a need to create awareness about haemophilia through education, knowledge sharing and information exchanges, says Dr Anoop P, senior consultant in haematology and pediatric hemato-oncology, Apollo Hospitals. \"If haemophilia is not diagnosed early, the repeated bleeding into joints, bones\\xa0and muscles may lead to synovitis, arthritis and permanent joint deformities. The bleeding itself can lead to wasting and atrophy of muscles,\" he points out.What is haemophilia?Haemophilia is a bleeding disorder where the person suffers from defective clotting protein and requires external blood factors to avoid bleeding in case of an injury. Based on the clotting factor the disease is categorised into haemophilia A and haemophilia B. Patients with severe haemophilia A constitute nearly 70% of the sufferers. It occurs in one in 5,000 males while haemophilia B is seen in one in 20,000. Though considered an inherited disease, around 30% of patients do not have any history of family members with haemophilia, making it very difficult to identify the condition.

Her rent is Rs 20,000.“We have so many young students in our creative writing programme that I wonder how they will make it in this country where it is difficult to be a full-time writer,” Samhita said, adding that Indian authors have little access to grants and other financial support that authors in the West enjoy.According to data provided by Penguin Books, Random House and Simon & Schuster Publishing, the number of books being published in India is growing at a rate of 15%. Simon & Schuster, which often fields 15 books a month, aspires to sell at least 4,000 copies every month.

Now, I am looking to get back into software.”\\xa0According to figures released by the publishing industry, 82,000 books are released every year in India. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

As Bengalureans were deep asleep, more than 100 astronomy enthusiasts and kids flocked to the planetarium to catch a glimpse of various planets of the solar system.What initially began as a small event at 4.00 am, soon turned into something big, with several people along with their kids descending on the planetarium for the ‘Sky Watch’ programme organised by the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium along with the Association of Bangalore Amateur Astronomers (ABAA). As the event coincided with the summer holidays, kids turned up in big\\xa0numbers for the event.\\xa0Speaking to DH, Pramod Galgali, Director of the Planetarium, said, “The event was organised as Mercury, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn are visible in the morning sky. Though it is possible to see these planets during the day, they can be best seen during the morning sky. Hence the event was organised early in the morning from 4.00 am till the sunrise.”The free event was attended by several astronomy enthusiasts and students. Vikas, a student from Vasanth Nagar, said he was “thrilled” to see the planets for the first time.“Even though I had seen them in television documentaries, watching them through the telescope was indeed a different experience. I enjoyed the programme besides getting to know some unknown facts about sky watching,” he said.The different telescopes for public viewing were arranged by the members of the ABAA.\\xa0The organisers were hopeful that the event will attract more visitors.“A few months ago, we had organised a similar event and it was attended by a huge crowd,” Galgali said.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

For instance, we have this golf-swing analyser that many feel pointless to buy. But they would rent it since everyone is in a rush to experience new things,” Parikh explains.Homemaker Minal Sanghvi had seen her five-year-old son’s fascination for electronic toys. But she knew that fascination was a passing phase, and spending thousands would be a waste.She chose to rent out the Cozmo robot instead. “Imagine his joy when we got home the high-end robot that plays with you, learns from you, reacts and becomes your buddy. No, we didn’t buy this set worth Rs 10,000, but just rented it out for the weekend,” she recalls.Parikh used his Amazon experience to merge e-commerce’s ease of delivery and transaction with the rental services. “Majority of products we offer have been bought by us from across the world, giving us total control over their availability, quality and condition.”\\xa0To ensure the rented products are returned in good condition, a security deposit is levied. This is refunded once the product is returned and checked.Once a particular product booked online, a confirmation and status of the order is sent to the customer. The platform’s delivery personnel take it to the customer’s home and demonstrates how the product works.Before taking a rental decision, the customer could also check a product demo video and usage manuals online.DH News Service Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

Not so surprisingly, parents queue up in large numbers to find a place for their wards.“I was searching for a different summer camp and came across the Android app building,” said Chetan L, father of a nine-year-old boy passionate about technology and aerodynamics.Poorvi M, who signed her daughter up in a course on manners, found the offering “different” from other programmes. “There’s no harm if children learn more,” she added.Ashwin Yadiyala S, Managing Trustee, Sparrows Group of Education, introduced the course on manners and etiquette for the first time. “It’s important that they learn discipline. It’s also important that they recognize and respect other people, something that should be taught at an early age,” he said.Since both their parents are busy working, they spend very little time with their wards, resulting in children learning less manners and etiquette from them. “We teach them how to greet and behave with others in social gathering,” Yadiyala said.Narasimha Naidu, a STEM educator from EduTech Stem Studio, said courses are designed on 21st-century technology skills. Students are trained on engineering and science education platforms.Besides, students between ages 8 and 14 show a greater level of interest in courses on mentorship, budget planning, marketing management, entrepreneurship and partnership firms.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Fares of most of the private buses shot up on Friday night due to festive rush, as people made all efforts to reach their hometowns. Most of the operators stuck to the 50% hike - the limit set by the State Transport Authority (STA), though some charge more.Last month, the STA called a meeting of private bus operators and warned them against hiking the rates beyond 50% of the normal fares. The instruction was given following complaints by the public that they are forced to pay a bomb during weekend rush and festive season.However, unlike the KSRTC, private buses do not have a base fare. Officials said some private operators were using this loophole in the STA’s argument to charge more than 100%.On the Bengaluru-Hubballi route, the normal fare for non-AC sleeper bus went up from the range of Rs 800-900 to Rs 1,100-1,400. On the Mangaluru route, a leading operator charged Rs 3,000 for a seat, which usually costs less than Rs 1,000.A senior official from the regional transport office (RTO) said they were monitoring the fares for violation of the direction. When asked about the Rs 3000 ticket for Mangaluru, he said RTO inspectors were trying to book the ticket, which will be used as evidence for action against the operators.“We are also trying to book tickets online through app and web interface of some operators and aggregators. Buses charging high fares will be penalised,” the official added.The state government has been sitting on a proposal by the RTO to fix minimum and maximum fare per kilometre for buses running on contract carriage permit (running from point A to B without stops). The existing fare rules apply only for buses running on stage carriage permit (operating like city transport with multiple stops).Last week, Transport Commissioner V P Ikkeri said the subject will be taken up after the elections.

The children’s father Mallappa was out of town and their mother Kavitha had gone out when the incident occurred, the police said.The incident came to light around 1.30 pm when Kavitha, who found the children missing, checked the sump after seeing the wooden planks covering it were displaced. She then saw both her children had drowned and screamed for help. Neighbours rushed to the spot and pulled out the children from the sump and shifted them to a hospital where both were declared brought dead.According to the police, Mallappa had gone to Yadgir for 15 days to meet his first wife, while his wife Kavitha, her mother and grandmother along with the children were staying in the makeshift shed.The police suspect the children may have wandered near the sump when Kavitha had gone out. They probably removed the planks covering it and fell into the sump, they said.The KR Puram police who are investigating, have ruled out foul play and have taken up a case of unnatural death. The police also said that the owner of the building had provided shelter to Mallappa’s family. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Professors from National Law School India University (NLSIU) have prepared a comprehensive law on water management that proposes to have all departments concerning with water under one umbrella of law, implement and follow it.Agriculture minister N H Shivashankara Reddy in December 2018 had approached Dr M K Ramesh, professor of law, NLSIU, and his team, to prepare a thorough law to include all aspects of water and its protection. Accordingly, the law professor and his team have come up with a draft law.According to Dr Ramesh, till date, no states have come up with any comprehensive law on water except Rajasthan that had a law with some inputs from the law university.“A law on water would bring all the stakeholders, i.e. the departments, under one umbrella of law to follow one set of rules. As far as Bengaluru is concerned, there is already an uneven distribution of water to the city dwellers. Incorporating water law and enforcing it would help everyone to get equal water supply,” he said.Explaining about people-centric initiatives and traditions like Jal Biradari in Rajasthan and Pani Panchayat in Maharashtra, which have demonstrated enduring value of traditional wisdom and communitarian contributions to good water governance, Dr Ramesh said these traditional water conservators should be recognised and accommodated into the system of water governance in the state of their origin.“There are traditional conservators even in Karnataka. It is just a matter of time for the government to identify them and their contribution,” he added.The objective of the law** Legal empowerment of water users by crystallisation of their rights and securing them.** Accommodation and adoption of good traditions and best-practices in water resource management by communities.** Developing linkages and strengthening the bonds of the relation between water users, line agencies, statutory bodies and constitutional institutions and evolving mechanisms for their coordinated and harmonious functioning.** Law for conservation, protection, equitable and efficient use and to safeguard water, food and ecological security and sustainability.** Law to converge, consolidate and harmonise all existing laws and institutions of enforcement.** Guiding principles, the doctrine of public trust, equity, sustainable use and conservation.** Top priority to human and ecological needs.** Community participation, restoration, efficient, equitable, beneficial and optimal use-strategies of governance.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The loss of green cover, the mushrooming of apartment complexes and the growing piles of garbage have compounded the monkey menace in the city, especially on the outskirts.\\xa0Now, it’s a double whammy for citizens. They have to pay a bomb to get rid of the animals. Apartment associations are being asked to pay anything between Rs 65,000 and Rs 1 lakh for the capture and release of monkeys to conducive habitats.\\xa0“Monkeys raid our place every day. They rummage through garbage buckets, snatch lunch boxes from children and even enter our homes. We approached the Karnataka Forest Department, which routed us to monkey catchers, who in turn demanded Rs 1 lakh. The relief lasted just a week... the monkeys returned,” said Dinesh, a resident of an apartment complex in Vidyaranyapura.Sujatha from Sarjapura Road had a similar experience. “Initially, the rescuer demanded Rs 1 lakh. He claimed to be an expert from Maharashtra. When we tried to buy time, he brought the fee down to Rs 85,000. Monkeys have attacked children and women,” she said.Some apartment complexes are using firecrackers to drive away monkeys. This “special” duty is entrusted with the security guards.Karnataka Forest Department officials said that it was up to the apartment owner and animal rescuer to fix the cost. The department has only given permission to catch monkeys and release them into conducive habitats under Section 11(1-A) of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, said R Gokul, Chief Conservator of Forests, Bengaluru.“People approach us, saying there is a threat to children and that properties are being damaged. Appropriate directions have been issued to the deputy conservator of forests. Unlike rural areas, monkeys face no threat from predators like leopards in the city. Food is also in abundance. They are unable to move around, as there are no vast spaces in the city. Thus, the menace is increasing,” Gokul said.Forest Department and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials cite garbage mismanagement. “Since citizens are not managing their garbage, monkeys and street dogs are thriving,” said a BBMP official.However, urban conservationists are divided on whether to capture the simians or let them be.\\n\\xa0Fruit trees to feed monkeysThe Forest Department has come up with some novel initiatives to address the monkey menace in urban spaces. It plans to plant as many fruit trees as possible in the forest areas surrounding Bengaluru. The decision has already been implemented at the Jarakbande\\xa0Kaval forest area near Yelahanka where the department officials have taken up planting of native species, especially fruit-bearing trees, on close to 50 acres.\\xa0Speaking to DH, a senior official\\xa0of the Bengaluru Urban forest department said, \"Currently, most of the forest patches around Bengaluru have eucalyptus trees. But ever since the government banned these trees, we have been clearing them in a phased manner as and when the plantation is ready for harvest. Soon after clearing these trees, we are planting native species, including fruit varieties like mango, tamarind, jamun and ficus species, so that they provide food for the monkeys. This has begun at Jarakbande Kaval,\" the official said.It is the lack of food in the forest that has prompted the primates to stray into human habitations, the official observed.\\xa0\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

The toll booth staff and other motorists rushed to the victims’ help and tried to extricate them from the car fearing it could catch fire.The police rushed to the spot and shifted the victims to BGS Global Hospital.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday A massive fire broke out at a realtor’s house in Mallarabanavadi, rural Nelamangala, on Monday. The blaze gutted the house in its entirety.\\xa0According to fire department officials, the fire may have started due to\\xa0a short-circuit or the lamps lit in the puja room. The house belonged to Ramadhamaiah, who is also a local BJP leader. He is the owner of Garudashree Properties.His wife and daughter were present at the time when the fire broke out. Noticing the smoke, they rushed out and called the fire services. The fire started around 3.30 pm and went on until 5.30 pm as the two fire tenders at the Nelamangala fire station had rushed to a ground grass fire at a eucalyptus grove near Begur in Dobbspet.Two fire tenders from the Magadi Road fire station near Sunkadkatte had to be summoned from the city to reach Mallarabanavadi to contain the fire. The firefighters took at least two to three hours to extinguish it. The worth of the damage is yet to be ascertained by the owner. The air-conditioned bungalow had expensive wooden fittings and accessories which were completely burnt. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The whole of Karnataka is reeling under severe shortage of water, with farmers facing a bitter crisis in the wake of groundwater levels fast depleting and reservoirs drying up.But the elite coconut seed farm at Kannamangala in East\\xa0Bengaluru managed by the Horticulture department — where the government is developing a new Lalbagh — has shown the state what best can be done with the little water it has.Using every drop judiciously, the farm has not only increased its coconut yield from previous years, but is also paving the way for the creation of a verdant lung space in a region where the water table has depleted beyond 1,000 to 1,500 feet. Until last year, the farm in Whitefield limits used to wilt under scorching heat. The yield dropped considerably for 30 years. But the farm has sprung to life with the announcement of creation of a new Lalbagh in the area.Rudresh, the proprietor of Lalbagh, said that judicious management of water sources resulted in a 30% increase in yield. “Besides the shortage of labour, the borewells had also dried up. But our efforts to revive the farm by providing nutrient inputs and judicious management of water sources resulted in a good yield. Each palm is giving us about 80 to 100 coconuts a year,” Rudresh said.The 152-acre coconut farm has about 3,500 palms of different varieties.The officials and labourers recharged the dried up borewells and also switched over to sprinkler system of irrigation. It saved a lot of water, which will be used to raise fresh\\nsaplings.“As the new Lalbagh is taking shape, it requires even more water in the days to come. Hence we have linked with surrounding industries and residential layouts to source treated water for the garden maintenance. We have plans of raising mixed cropping, multi-tier cropping, inter-cropping and border cropping plantation with a variety of palms and other flora and thereby creating the largest lung space in the region,” a senior horticulture official revealed.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday As part of the ambitious Smart Cities Mission, the\\xa0researchers\\xa0at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have designed charging ports for drones atop streetlights.Battery backup is a major challenge that\\xa0drones are facing at the moment. The technical team working at the Robert Bosch Centre, IISC, has addressed this problem. Now, drones can skip returning\\xa0to base stations\\xa0or crash landing once the batteries are drained.The innovation is the brainchild of Dr Ashish V Joglekar, a technical staff at the Robert Bosch Centre. Joglekar, along with the assistance of Vishwas Navada, designed the charging ports, which will be installed on top of streetlight poles.At the recent IISc Open Day, the team demonstrated how the system works. “When the battery is about to be exhausted, drones will search for the nearest charging port installed on streetlight poles. Drones can independently search for the nearest port using GPS and can home in,”\\xa0Joglekar told DH.This will initially cater to online shopping platforms, planning to deliver\\xa0merchandise\\xa0using drones, where battery backup is the prime concern.\\xa0A drone low on battery will complete charging within an hour.“We are working on reducing the charging time,” said Vishwas Navada adding that the facility will serve many other purposes than just product delivery.”The team is to hold talks with concerned authorities like the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and power generators bodies to bring in norms\\xa0and specifications for the ports.“We are expecting norms to be passed on the mode of drone landing assistance, types of drones that can have the feature, safety and charging capability,”\\xa0Joglekar\\xa0further added.

Prof Y Narahari, divisional head at IISc’s Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, said the robot is just two feet in length.“Stoch has 12 joints (three per leg) to generate motion similar to a quadrupedal animal (a dog or cat),” added Dhaivat Dholakiya from the Institute.The prototype of the self-operational robot which the Institute has developed could also be used as a rover on the moon, Prof Narahari revealed. “We have used Reinforcement Learning and AI-based technique to generate these walking behaviours,” Dholakiya said.“In a nutshell, we’ve tried to make the robot learn the walking behaviour by itself using the algorithm.”The unmanned aerial vehicles show by the department of aerospace engineering is expected to draw more crowds this time as well.IISc said at least 1,000 of its 4,500 students are involved in organising the Open Day.

But of the hundreds of applications received, hardly three to four are from the 110 village areas, he added.Kemparamaiah, BWSSB engineer-in-chief, said as there is more demand for water during summer, it is quite obvious that more people want to sink new borewells.“We are not completely restricting. However, we also have to check excessive drilling of borewells that leads to exploitation of groundwater,” he added.Kemparamaiah said there should also be some restriction on the extraction of water from borewells also as they are bound to be exploited. There is a need for some metering system to limit drawing of water from certain borewells.According to an official from the Karnataka Groundwater Authority there was no metering system to check the extraction of water from borewell till now. However there are plans to implement the system in the future, he added.Saving groundwaterSince January 2019, 633 applications received to sink new borewells.\\xa0Only 138 applications have been processed and approved.Most of the applications from the core areas rejected.\\xa0According to official records, there are about 3.71 borewells in the city.

Through the survey, we’re also asking the state to train them in using the safety and mobility aids,” Ramesh added.The survey found that in the absence of technology training, visually impaired women resort to primitive aids like folding knives, safety pins and even the stylus they use to punch the Braille code for self-defence.While most of them use technology, those unfamiliar with modern aids are willing to get trained at the earliest.\\xa0“Mobility training is vital for all blind people to navigate freely,” he said.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Try as you might, you will be find it hard to come across\\xa0 sparrows in Bengaluru. Once ubiquitous, the little bird is yet to return to the city, thanks to reckless urbanisation.Ornithologists are now calling for sustained efforts to revive the dwindling sparrow population in the city.According to them, just keeping nest boxes and feeders have yielded little results over the years.\\xa0Since the last five years, on every World Sparrow Day on March 20, ornithologists and conservationists distribute around 100 bamboo-made, nest and feeder boxes free of cost. Each box costs the distributor around Rs 400. But the initiative doesn’t seem to have helped.As a result, sparrows have now become localised to smaller places in the city, such as\\xa0Yeshwanthpur or KR Market, which is not a good sign.Ornithologists are now requesting the government and builders to change the construction pattern and build more eco-friendly buildings having crevices.They add that city outskirts, where sparrows are found, need careful planning. According to them, the Kempegowda International Airport is a threat for sparrows.\\xa0Ecologist and ornithologist M B Krishna says there has been little success with the nest boxes. “It is important to understand that it is about just nest boxes but creating an environment for sparrows. Pollution, loss of native trees and lung spaces are also a major concern,” he says.According to him, sparrows need insects, which can be found on native and fruit-bearing tree species, instead of mono-culture and lawns. The idea of BBMP creating smaller parks is good.“To bring them back a lot needs to be done, especially in town planning,” says Krishna.Sudhira H S, Director Gubbi Labs, who did a study on sparrows, says over 40 sparrows were seen near Yeshwanthpur railway station on Tumkur Road.“But after the tree was cut to make way for foot overbridge, they disappeared. A few individual sparrows were seen in Malleswaram 5th Cross, but since last year they are not to be seen. Some can still be seen in Sudhamanagar, Jakkur and Sanjayanagar,” says Sudhira.Mohammed Dilawar, Founder and President of Nature Forever Society, popularly known as ‘Sparrow Man’, advocates planting local tree species apart from keeping nest boxes.“There is also a need for sustained effort. Many pay attention for a month or so and later forget. Government and builders should also be roped in for eco- friendly buildings,” he says. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

This would be\\xa0one of the professional courses in geography,” a senior official from BU told DH.BU will be offering MSc in Disaster Management, MA in Film Studies and MA in Animation and Graphics from next academic year.\\xa0As the most number of seats remained vacant the previous year, the BU syndicate decided to give importance for professional courses. Since film media and animation and graphics have greater scope, they have finalised the curriculum.“We have the infrastructure to start the above courses. For animation and graphics, all we need is computer systems, which will be set up at a reasonable cost. And for film media, we are planning to tie up with film institutes, which will be more than happy to help us in practicals. A few years down the line, we will be having our own film institute on the campus,” Venugopal K R, vice-chancellor, BU, told DH.Talking about disaster management, Venugopal added: “It’s not necessary to approach disaster management\\xa0from a negative perspective. It could also be about avoiding the adverse effects of a natural\\xa0calamity or the management after a disaster. Due to climate change, the world is open to the risk of many natural calamities. The course is designed in such a way that the students will be exposed to all the aspects, like medical emergencies and others.” Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

She was a regular at the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium.“I combined my passion for astronomy to my work. I am doing research on experimental surface science techniques like Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy to study and understand the catalytic properties of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar medium,” she told DH from Denmark.In 2012, Rijutha was one among the 30 undergraduates selected from all over India to attend the 6th Asian Science Camp in Israel, where 5-6 Nobel laureates interacted with young scientists over a few days.“It was a turning point in my life.

The fresh supply can be purchased only after the government releases grant after which the hospital floats tenders.Pavitra, Jaishruthi’s mother, said they had approached the court to get an order for their daughter to be treated free of cost for LSD at the hospital.“We have been meeting many officials and ministers to get our daughter treated. While this is taking time, my daughter is running out of time,” Pavitra said.Similarly, Revathi (12), who was under medication for Gaucher, also a rare disease, has not been given a dosage of the medication since January.Shivashankar, her father, said he was also struggling to get the medicines. “It has been 45 days since my daughter has received her dose of medicine for gaucher. Although she is attending her school, she is getting tired very quickly which is not a good sign,” said Shivashankar.Meanwhile, Prasanna Kumar Shirol, executive director of Organisation for Rare Diseases in India (ORBI), said as the IGICH does not have a director, procuring medicines is taking time as they have to call fresh tenders.“Treatment for LSD including, gaucher, pompe and mucopolysaccharide (MPS), is very expensive. The amount depends on the weight of the patients. So for 10 kg, the cost of the medicine would go up to Rs 40 lakh per month. The high court has directed the government to treat these patients and the government allocates funds for this purpose,” he added.Dr Naveen Benakappa, the in-charge director and medical superintendent,\\xa0IGICH, said the government granted Rs 3 crore to get medications for the rare diseases. “We have got the funds three days ago and will shortly procure the medicines directly without floating any tenders,” he added.

In Bengaluru, the event is scheduled to be held in Indiranagar on the day of Holi.“This initiative will be carried out to give a special meaning to the festival. Heartfulness, its partner organisations and local communities aim to spread the message of peace by applying this mixture on the trees on the festival of colours,” Sourabh Shinde, the organiser of the campaign told DH“Painting trees with the mixture of lime and herbal extract helps protect them from the scorching summer heat, termites, insects, infections and cracking of the bark. So Holi is not just about playing with colours. We want to make it eco-friendly,” Shinde added. Beside painting trees, the campaign also includes planting endemic tree saplings. The month-long event is scheduled in over 40 cities all over the country.Sourabh said: “The initiative is very economical. To paint 500 trees, it will cost us anywhere between Rs 700 and Rs 1,000. It is the same amount an individual or a group spends to celebrate to get Holi colour. So its not hefty on our pockets.” More than 500 volunteers are said to be taking part in the campaign and the number is expected to cross thousand. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday It has been three years since the government banned the manufacturing and use of plastic, but traders and the public remain obsessed over its use.So, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike decided to launch a crackdown on plastic use, and on Saturday, targeted swanky malls in the city. They found a flagrant violation of the plastic ban by traders, who used plastic materials disregarding rules.As the team of BBMP health officials raided six shopping malls — Orion mall (west zone), Garuda mall (east zone), Forum mall (south zone), Phoenix mall in Mahadevapura, RMZ Galleria in Yelahanka and Meenakshi mall in Bommanahalli — they found a popular supermarket chain and ice cream stores violating the plastic ban.Firms operating in these malls did not segregate dry and wet waste. The shops were collectively fined Rs 13.15 lakh, while officials seized about one tonne of plastic materials (1,010 kilograms), including packing materials and cups.\"The civic body received complaints that many malls have failed to comply with the plastic ban,\" BBMP health officer Balasundar A S said.\"The malls in the six zones were found using plastic in shops, food courts, supermarkets and upscale showrooms.\" The BBMP has also cancelled trade licences of four hotels operating in these malls.

       " [\"Life on Bengaluru's Namma Metro\",\n",
       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Travelling in private cars or on two-wheelers has become a tiresome task in Bengaluru. And Namma Metro has come as a boon for those, including this author, to escape the drudgery of driving back after a tiring day at work.The Metro is a great way to get around in Bengaluru. But it can be a tough ride at peak hours in jam-packed coaches, with commuters getting squeezed and subjected to a lot of jostling. This is one of the negative sides of a Metro ride. But, it is not all bad news. There is an ample number of people amusing fellow passengers with their antics and thus providing comic relief during a trying journey.Silly antics I have witnessed can be stress busters, but some dangerous things people do make me wonder if they just don’t care about their or fellow passengers’ safety.Wrong platform\\nDeciphering the signage to enter the right platform can be a tough task for those who are not regulars on the Metro. But it does no harm to ask the Metro staff about the right platform. This author saw a recent incident when a young couple barged onto a platform, but saw their train entering the station on the other side. “Oh s@!&” went the gentleman before commencing the long trudge to the right side.Eager for entry\\nEveryone is clearly told to give way to alighting passengers. Along comes a guy who firmly believes he is within his rights to enter before others can exit. Sure, all of us would like to get into the car quickly. But his exuberance in trying to get in surely made other passengers and me wonder what he is going to gain out of doing this. He is clearly inconveniencing others. The bloke fell into line only after getting a mouthful from the security staff.No entry\\nIt seems like all common sense can fail at times. Standing in a long queue to enter is boring no doubt. Wondering why the rush on that day, passengers had to sulk and bear it. There was one lady who decided to do something about it – trying to enter through the exit gate. Much to the amusement of the passengers in the queue, she repeatedly tried to swipe the token despite a red ‘X’ on the display indicating no entry. Better sense prevailed after a few failed attempts and passengers in the queue had a bit of entertainment.In your face\\nTravelling during peak hours can be uncomfortable no doubt. But it can get embarrassing too as passengers are stuffed like sardines in a can. I, just like other passengers, find it rather annoying when my face is just a few centimetres away from another person’s. What makes things worse is realising that one can’t even turn away. Even if one manages to wriggle in another direction, there is every chance of another ‘in your face’ encounter.No network\\nWatching videos on YouTube or listening to music is a great way to kill time on the Metro. The odd passenger can get frustrated if the data transfer stops in the underground sections. What is amusing is the fact that the hardcore movie and music lovers don’t want any pause to their ‘entertaining’ journey. Funnily, they don’t give up and try to refresh the page, press play/ pause more than a few times. No avail, theirs is an agonising wait till the train emerges from the underground section.Door confusion\\nAgain, occasional Metro travellers have a tough time figuring out which side the doors will open where they need to get off. Which side the doors will open is announced well in advance. There are a few who are in a different world and pay no attention to the announcement. The result is a heroic effort to get through the maze of people. The more aggressive ones manage it. For a few, it is a return journey back to the right station.Use deodorant pleaseNamma Metro cars are air-conditioned and travelling is a ‘cool’ experience. No question about pollution or dust, but one has to put up with another problem – smelly passengers. The last thing one would want is a smelly fellow passenger as a neighbour. If it was the Mumbai trains, the breeze would take away some of the odour. But, in the Metro, one has to just tolerate it. The thought of telling the ‘offending’ person to use deodorant unfortunately can only remain a thought.Escalator charge\\nNot seen Carl Lewis and Marion Jones in action? The Metro could provide you with a glimpse of their extraordinary speed. The announcement says the train is about to pull into the station. That is the trigger for a quick sprint up the escalator to catch the train, but that success is only after pushing and shoving a few people up the escalator.It is understandable that people are in a hurry to get to their destination as quickly as possible. However, it is important to spare a thought for fellow passengers. It might be funny at times, but some of these antics could lead to a serious accident. A dozen alighting passengers could knock a person down because they are in a hurry to get off too before the train leaves.Namma Metro has framed rules for a safe and a comfortable journey. It is best that commuters follow them even if it means a little less entertainment on the journey back home from work. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

More than 50 RWA members will stage a demonstration demanding cancellation of the tenders for the controversial project. The protest will begin at 10 am in front of the Gandhi statue at Maurya Circle.The citizens’ groups that had rallied against the steel flyover project a few years ago, have again come together with a bigger coalition of civic, social and RWAs from different parts of the city.In fact, considering the large turnout, several political parties have expressed their support for Saturday’s demonstration.However, the citizens’ groups have rejected any political support citing that all political parties have collectively contributed to the growing mess. Organisers have clarified that it will be a peaceful demonstration. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Next time you\\xa0drink\\xa0a glass of water, remember this: The city’s groundwater is filled with deadly chemicals and radioactive metals. When used for drinking water purposes, contaminated water can lead to a host of health problems.\\xa0One of the toxic substances found in the city’s groundwater is uranium - a radioactive\\xa0substance\\xa0that is known to cause kidney damage.A 2015 study by the Department of Physics in Bangalore University - “Radiological and chemical toxicity due to ingestion of uranium through drinking water in the environment of Bangalore, India” - found presence of uranium in borewells in southern Bengaluru.In the study, 61% of 96 borewells contained uranium within the safe limit of 30μgL−1 (micrograms per litre) as set by the World Health Organisation. About 6% of the samples showed values higher than the acceptable level for radiological risk and 39% of the samples showed risk due to chemical toxicity of uranium.Dr N Nagaiah, professor, department of physics, Bangalore University, said that uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element found in certain groundwater samples. “Whether this concentration of radioactive elements has affected the health of the citizens through kidney damage is something which needs to be studied in the long run,” he added.Dr Manjunath, nephrologist, BR Life SSNMC Hospital, said ingestion of heavy and radioactive metals through water and air can damage kidneys.“One of the major cause of kidney disease in recent days is uranium-contaminated water,”said Manjunath. “This causes chronic interstitial nephritis and leads to kidney disease. Increased exposure to an excess amount of uranium can cause permanent damage to the kidneys. It also increases the risk of hypertension, and anaemia or low blood count. The pollutant in the water gets stored in the body, especially in the bones, kidneys and liver after oral ingestion or inhalation.”\\xa0Dr Sushma Rani R, senior consultant, Nephrology, Sakra World Hospital, said uranium in groundwater gets accumulated in kidneys and other organs. “It especially affects the tubular functions of the kidney and may cause chronic kidney disease. Problems arise when there is chronic ingestion of uranium in drinking water. Uranium is more harmful due to its toxic nature rather than its radioactivity and it has been identified as a kidney toxin by World Health Organization (WHO),” she said.

With temperatures soaring, the mortality rate of city fauna is set to surge.Activists and the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) are now conducting awareness campaigns to keep water bowls in the open for\\xa0birds\\xa0and animals.Recently, K Mohan, member of the BBMP animal rescue team (forest cell) saved five different varieties of\\xa0birds, found lying unconscious due to dehydration from heat stroke in the city.The maximum temperature in the city touched 37 degrees Celsius last week, severely affecting\\xa0birds\\xa0and animals in the predominantly concrete landscape.Various Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) along with the civic body have rescued more than 300\\xa0birds\\xa0from the start of February.“The animals are dying due to dehydration. More than 300\\xa0birds\\xa0and animals have been rescued till now,” Mohan told\\xa0DH.“Birds\\xa0such as black kites, owls, sparrows, pigeons, crows and animals like dogs, cats, cows, squirrels and monkeys are suffering. Most of the calls we receive are to rescue these animals and\\xa0birds,” he added.Rescue teams rush to the spot and immediately shift the\\xa0bird\\xa0or animal to the nearest veterinary clinic or hospital and inject a dose of glucose. They will be kept in the rehabilitation centre till they recover and will be released later.“The volunteers from NGOs and the BBMP are now advising the residents on how to protect animals from heat strokes. Placing water bowls in backyards and terraces is the first step,” explained Mohan.Sanjeev Pednekar, the founder of ‘Prani, the pet sanctuary’, near Somanahalli off Kanakpura road, blames the lack of green cover and seasonal changes in environment.Both citizens and authorities have to play a role to save the fauna during summer. The citizens should place water bowls and provide facilities like birdbaths in the garden, he added.Pednekar also stressed the need for more veterinary hospitals and doctors in the city.“The BBMP should make\\xa0it mandatory for future developmental projects and high-rises to incorporate architectural elements like birdbaths,” he said.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday A city-based inventor and a government health official unveiled a new device to address the sticky problem of piles, which they said contributes to a 40% decline in workforce efficiency.Speaking to DH on Tuesday, Dr Rajah Vijay Kumar, described piles or hemorrhoids, as not only being one of the oldest known ailments known to humans but also the most secretive. “Husbands don’t tell wives, wives don’t tell husbands,” he said.In\\xa0an effort to keep the condition secret, sufferers spurn their doctors and instead turn to unlicensed medical practitioners for ointments, creams and suppositories, added Dr T S Prabhakar of the Karnataka Department of Health and Family Welfare.“This new device is a way to fight back against quacks,” Dr Prabhakar said adding that the government had registered several deaths due to treatments recommended by unlicensed practitioners. Dr Prabhakar could not be reached later for clarification.The device, which is priced at roughly Rs 6,900 per unit, involves cooling its inner nano-material to a temperature of -18 degrees C, using a common freezer. Once cooled, the device is applied to the affected area where the nano material gradually releases cold temperatures over a 10-minute period.Dr Kumar insisted the procedure could be be done in the privacy of one’s home and was relatively non-invasive. “There is no cold shock or frostbite,” he said. “I am proud to say that I was patient number one.”When queried about the cost of the product which might deter some Indians, Samson John, director of a renewable energy company which has partnered with Dr Kumar, insisted that it is the cheapest solution to treating piles in the market. “Ointments are a temporary measure and surgeries are expensive and time-consuming,” he said. “Of the 1,291 people who used the device in clinical trials, 88.7% said they had been cured.”As per figures released by WHO and the Rajiv Gandhi Institute, roughly 41 million people in India suffer from piles. Furthermore, 1.2 million new cases are diagnosed every year, said Dr Kumar. Nearly 40% of these are pregnant women while 60% are people living in South India. The harmful effects of the condition is said to cause job absenteeism and a 30 to 40% drop in efficiency across the job market.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Over 3,000 farmers will gather at the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) head office on Tuesday in protest against the government over the delay in the Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) project.The farmers, who have lost land to the ambitious project, said they are not against the PRR. Instead, they want the project to start so that they can get proper compensation and move on with their lives.Raghu, a farmer participating in the protest, said: “We were given notice for land acquisition in 2005. But to this day, nothing has happened. We can use the soil for cultivation, but cannot dig borewells. We cannot mortgage the property for a\\xa0loan or seek help from financiers as our land has been marked for the project.”Most of them have to get their daughters married, support the education of their children or meet the medical expenses of ailing family members.“In the last 10 years, the government has only conducted meetings. In the last two years, the BDA has not even called for any meeting. Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, who claims to be a pro-farmer CM, has also done nothing. In the name of loan waiver, he has neglected us, as our land is listed to be acquired for development,” said another farmer.Due to the uncalled-for delay, farmers have now agreed to part with their land for cash compensation as decided under the land acquisition bill of 2012. They are not interested in the 40:60 land-sharing scheme.“We have seen what happened in the case of Arkavathy Layout. Those who lost land are still suffering. If the land costs around Rs 10 crore, we demand that the government give us Rs 5 crore immediately and put the remaining in banks, so that we can at least earn interest from it,” Raghu said.Many farmers said they are now making a living by selling vegetables and doing odd jobs in the city, as part of their land is infertile and they have no money for labour.The BDA is said to acquire 1,800 acres of land from around 4,000 people.

It strictly avoids meat, fish, and eggs,” the spokesperson said.“If the BBMP wants to provide eggs, we will not supply them to the school directly. The school management or concerned authority can procure eggs by other means and provide them to school,” the spokesperson added. Pasha said the eggs will be supplied by a separate vendor.In December, the inclusion of onions and garlic in the Akshaya Patra midday meal programme kicked up controversy even as several NGOs demanded eggs to be added as a supplement.Organisations and a few experts wrote to the Women and Child Development ministry saying including eggs would greatly enhance the nutritional value of the meals supplied to children.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday In the season of blooming, when everybody is sharing photographs of flowering trees in their neighbourhood on social media, there is a large section of people who are concerned about how new projects like the elevated corridor will contribute to the destruction of the remaining green cover of the city.\"Through the generations, people have been contributed to maintaining the green cover of the city. Now destroying the trees for projects such as elevated corridor is really depressing,\" says Srinivas Alavilli, member of Citizens for Bengaluru.\\n\"At least with the Metro, thousands of commuters were helped even though trees were felled. But the elevated corridor can only accommodate cars,\" he says.A few nature lovers, who shared the photographs of the season’s blooms on their Facebook walls, felt that \"It is important to contain the city\\'s development and spread out more evenly without losing out its greenery\".\"As we see people sharing pictures of trees and flowers they have clicked with love and affection, it is so ironic that we also get to see trees in public spaces being cut down,\" adds Srinivas.\"It is our responsibility to protect the green cover. If not, what will we leave for our future generations,\" he asks.With the spring coming early this year the flowering trees in Bengaluru are in full bloom.Now it is the time for the \\'Silver Trumpet\\' tree!In Bengaluru, there are many Silver Trumpet trees, which are mostly found in old Bengaluru areas like Jayanagar, Rajajinagar, Basavanagudi etc.A native of South America \\'Tabebuia Argentea\\' (yellow flowers) is commonly known as the Silver Trumpet tree. The fluorescent yellow flowers are trumpet-shaped with some species having double-layered petals.\"The flowering season starts from February and will be on till April. These trees will be in a vegetative for almost 11 years,\" says M Jagadeesh, Joint Director of the Lalbagh Botanical Garden’s Horticulture Department.A Silver Trumpet, planted in Lalbagh Botanical Garden by former prime minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru during his visit to the city, is in full bloom and it is thanks to the efforts of the Horticulture Department.“With the help of tree surgeries and regular pruning, we are able to keep the plant growth in check and maintain the shape. Also, with the help of a good canopy balance these trees can survive for 50-60 years,” Jagadeesh adds.The tree provides good shade and attracts everyone with its bright yellow blooms. It is surely an attention-getter.\\nVijay Nishanth, environmentalist and \\'tree doctor\\', shared the pictures of the \\'Silver\\xa0Trumpet\\' tree on his Facebook wall saying \"Bengaluru streets holds this beautyeverywheree in summer.[sic]\"\\xa0Nature lovers hope to see the \\'Silver Trumpet\\' in full bloom the next spring too!

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday In a move that will come as a shock for teachers in private-aided schools, the state government has decided to hold them responsible for poor student performance.\\xa0As per the new rules, the\\xa0Department of Education can\\xa0hold\\xa0teachers’ promotion and salaries besides annulling the grant-in-aid if a newly recruited teacher fails to ensure more than 60% result.\\xa0Permitting management of the schools to fill vacant posts, the government has cautioned that if freshly recruited teachers fail to ensure good results in their respective subjects, not only their salaries and promotions will be withheld but their\\xa0grant-in-aid will also be annulled if they continue with their dismal performance for three consecutive years.\\xa0In the corresponding five years, if 50%\\xa0of students in aided schools do not pass, grants to these schools would be withheld. According to the order, teachers have to ensure 60% results, failing which that year’s salary would be withheld. The Deputy Directors of Public Instruction have been asked to submit a detailed report on teachers and their performance every year.\\xa0According to the state government, until 2015, the government had permitted to fill as many as 3,633 vacant teachers’ posts in private-aided schools. However, going by the government’s diktat - that only schools with more than 60 per cent result or on par with the average result of the district be allowed to fill the posts - aided private schools were able to fill only 781 seats. In fact, this condition had triggered an intense debate in the Legislative Council and the government was under due pressure to relax the rules. But according to teachers’ representatives,\\xa0the latest results have turned out to be even more stringent.Commenting on the move, BJP MLC Arun Shahpur said, “This will create job insecurity among teachers. The government has relaxed one norm and added another five. This is nothing but slow poison for aided schools.”\\xa0Niranjanaradhya V P, Fellow, National Law School of India University (NLSIU), termed this as the last resort for the government. “They cannot have a discriminatory attitude. There are several private and government schools as well who are not up to the mark. Before you punish anyone for performance, it is your responsibility to create an enabling environment for them to perform,” he said. Terming employment is a matter of social security, he said, “You cannot just hire and fire. Relaxations of the previous norms are bad. The onus is on the institution and management to perform. It is wrong to punish individuals.” Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

With this, there is hope that more such sales will happen,” said Vinay G Sugur, engineer officer, BDA.“The BDA is in talks with many other companies and banks, but things are yet to materialise,” said a BDA official. “Discussions were going on for very long because of the pricing with Canara Bank.

This, however, does not include the registration charges and possession of the flats will be given by the end of March, once money is deposited to BDA account and after all procedures are completed.”\\xa0All flats under Phase-6 of Volegerahalli come in two bedroom-hall-kitchen configuration. The BDA constructed three blocks, with each comprising 120 flats.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Just recovering from the fog and Aero India-related flight disruptions, the Kempegowda International Airport is witnessing long queues yet again, but for a different reason: elaborate security checks triggered by a high alert following the Indo-Pak aerial showdown.The queues at the country’s third busiest airport are widespread, with passengers forced to stand for long hours at the baggage and security screening gates. Stressed over this, many travellers are taking to social media to vent their\\nfrustration.Ananth Sampath, a passenger, observed that he had to take off his shoe and belt at the security check. “I have not seen this in India before. Guess they need to buffer additional time at the airports. One hour is not enough,” he tweeted.The stress levels have gone up not only for passengers, but for the airlines and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) as well. “Tickets, too, have become more expensive due to cancelled flights,” noted another passenger, Mathew Thomas.The airport operator, Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) had this to say: “Access control at all gates of the airport have been tightened and the screening intensified. There were slight delays due to intense passenger screening, but all within acceptable limits.”\\xa0On Saturday, the Centre had directed all airports and airlines in the country to enhance the existing security measures. Issuing the alert, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) had marked it to senior police officials of all states, in-charges of security at all airlines and airports and CISF officers.The alert applied to all civil aviation installations such as airports, airstrips, airfields, air force stations, helipads, flying schools and aviation training institutes. Twenty specific enhanced security measures were cited to be in operation until further orders.Enhanced screening of passengers meant a 100% full pat-down search at pre-embarkation security checkpoints.The BCAS directive also required enhanced random screening of the airport staff and visitors at the main entrance to the terminal\\nbuilding.Even before the alert, long security queues have been an issue at KIA. BIAL had introduced the Automatic Tray Retrieval System (ATRS) to speed up the screening process. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The government should make it mandatory for IT companies to hire buses for employees’ transportation, which will boost ridesharing and ease traffic congestion in Whitefield and Electronic City, taxi drivers have said.The Indian Vehicle Drivers’ Union has appealed to Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy to\\xa0address the issue.“There are 6,500 IT-BT and IT-enabled companies in Bengaluru. Approximately 15 lakh people are employed in these companies,” said Gandasi Sadananda Swamy, president of the union. “While they are contributing to the economy, the city’s limited infrastructure is leading to traffic problems due to abnormal growth in number of vehicles. Ride-sharing is the only solution for the problem.”\\xa0The union also said that several IT companies had stopped “day trips” and instead were giving travel allowance to their employees. “Companies are giving Rs 5,000 transport charges (allowance) to employees, which is encouraging them to use own vehicles. Instead, they should embrace cost-effective solutions like hiring buses for a particular number of trips,” he said.The drivers’ union said that congestion was directly affecting their revenue because of delayed trips, while the increasing amount of time spent on the road was affecting their health. The union has suggested that the government make it compulsory for companies to hire BMTC buses.M R Kori, president of Whitefield Area Commerce and Industries Association, said the government should encourage IT firms to hire buses. “They should start by encouraging them and then make it compulsory. Ride-sharing is the best solution within the limited infrastructure,” he said.“Though many know the problems, they may not be aware of the solutions. We will conduct a meeting with members of our group and start a discussion in this regard,” he said. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

Shylaja brings stories to life by blending narration with performance. She has been a storyteller and a theatre person for the past 20 years, and so the skill is almost second nature.At the end of each story, she teaches children folksongs related to the origin of the story she narrated. The wide array of stories from Japan to Bengal is a treat to both their eyes and ears.“The best thing is, everyone has their own takeaway from these stories; their own perception about them. This’s beautiful,” she says.Storytelling is not restricted to children. Shylaja holds sessions for the adults that draw their subjects from short stories of famous authors like Rabindranath Tagore.“Children may find it harder to interpret those stories,” she says. “For children, it’s always the folktales from India and other countries, besides stories from children’s authors.”Shylaja is also the founder of Ninety Bold Tales, a performance art-based collective. She brings parents and children together with interactive methods, encouraging them to learn through storytelling. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

However, the project, despite support from the horticulture minister, has still remained on paper.A complete ban on movement of vehicles inside the park was one of the demands\\xa0put forward\\xa0by walkers and joggers during ‘Janaspandana’— a citizen interaction programme organised by Deccan Herald and Prajavani on November 26. Citizens wanted visitors and officials to walk or move around using a battery operated vehicle.The move had the backing of both officials and Horticulture minister M C Managuli, who expressed his support for the use of buggies.The previous director of horticulture, Y S Patil, had assured that the plan will be put in place in about one month with the purchase of buggies. However, even after a month, there is no sign of proposal seeing light of day. Officials\\nat the horticulture directorate revealed to DH that the project has stalled due to change of guard at the department level.A few weeks ago, the state government transferred horticulture director YS Patil as Deputy Commissioner of Vijayapura and posted Dr M V Venkatesh as the director of the horticulture department.“The new director has taken charge recently and is briefed about\\xa0the pending projects. We will also brief him about the problems raised by public, walkers and joggers and soon a ban on vehicles will be ordered as suggested by the minister,” a senior official from Lalbagh said.Meanwhile, the department has also hiked the entry fees to the gardens with effect from March 1.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday An ongoing green initiative has helped revive ponds and lakes as well as increase green cover in Nandi Hills in the last three years.The Nandi Lake and Pataala Ganga have been revived through the untiring efforts of former IFS officer and noted environmentalist AN Yellappa Reddy’s Bangalore Environment Trust and the United Way Bengaluru - both of whom have used CSR funds to rejuvenate water bodies as part of the “Save Nandi Hills campaign”.According to a report on the campaign’s activities, Nandi Lake was in terrible shape, with uncontrolled removal of soil and dumping of waste and debris virtually destroying the lake.The NGO along with the district administration and zilla panchayat took up a scientific study to revive the lake. The feeder canals blocked for several years were cleared and rainwater was allowed to flow into the lake.Apart from that, kalyanis (small ponds) were also revived. One such kalyani, Paataala Ganga, was choked with silt. So, the feeder canals were cleaned and water is now flowing into the Paataala Ganga, which is now raising the water level up in the Amrut Sarovara. To enhance bio-diversity, tree plantation drives and seed ball throwing initiatives were also carried out.The fertile red soil, manure and cow dung was used to make the seed balls by engaging volunteers from various companies.Drastic changeAbout 2,000 saplings of native fruit and flower-bearing species have been planted since the campaign began. This has also discouraged the proliferation of eucalyptus, which is known to be harmful to soil and water.Speaking about the rejuvenation project, Special Officer to Nandi Hills, Ramesh N, said that a drastic change could be seen ever since the activities began.“Although the government allocates funds for improving and maintaining Nandi Hills, it is not enough especially with the manpower crisis. The volunteers come in\\xa0hundreds, take up the task and finish it. More than funds, it the scientific method and the huge number of volunteers that is making the difference here,” Ramesh added.About 70 acres of Nandi Hills is controlled and maintained by the Horticulture department, while the remaining 3,500 acres of land is under the forest department.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The team of Six Indian Navy women called Tarini, the first Asian team to circumnavigate the globe in eight months, interacted with Mount Carmel college students.It was a part of National Geographics’s #GirlsWhoSailed initiative, ahead of International Women’s Day.Just like the sail, the crew comprising Lieutenant (Lt) Commander Pratibha Jamwal, Lt Commander Aishwarya Boddapati, Lt Commander P Swathi, Lt Commander S Vijaya Devi and Lt Payal Gupta, was lead by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi (skipper).“We never lost hope and never wanted to quit. We faced resistance from our parents and concerned senior colleagues. They said we might never return. But we proved them all wrong,” said the women crew. \\xa0“This is the message we want to give everyone, especially women…that we are equal. Capabilities are important. The sea does not know male or female. It will not differentiate. Nothing in the world can stop us, if we decide,” they added.A film ‘Tarini’ has also been made chronicling their journey known as ‘Navika Sagar Parikrama’.On September 10, 2017, the team took off from Goa. Their gruel voyage of 254 days covering 21,622 nautical miles ended on March 21, 2018.The team recounted their two storms of 20 hours each. The worst being the one they encountered in the Southern Hemisphere, close to Antarctica, called the Graveyard of Ships. The speed of the storm was 200 kmph against boat’s speed of 6-12 kmph.The crew recollected their experience in temperatures of 45 degree Celsius, 15 degree Celsius, zero degree Celsius and -7 degree Celsius.They recalled how they cut Chocowalnut cake when they crossed the Equator at 4.50 am, as a ritual to King Neptune, and sang Happy Equator song (reprised version). They recollected how they would touch earth each time they landed on ports and some lighter moments of fights and birthdays.Lt Commander Swathi said unlike solo circumnavigations, they had each other. The team drew inspiration from their trainer and first solo (2009) circum-navigator Dilip Done.“But it was difficult to leave families and others behind on this long voyage, especially for me as I was the only one who was married. We not only built a bond among ourselves, but also with the boat as we saw it getting built from a price of wood,” she said. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  \"Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The organisers of the 11th Edition of Bengaluru International Film Festival picked Iran as the focus country and the audience couldn't get enough of the films from the region. Not only were a variety of films showcased from Iran, but viewers also braved long lines to catch most of them.\\xa0Hattrick, a film by Ramtin Lavafi, was one such film which saw a packed theatre. The film had the audience rapt in attention and also evoked from them apt reactions. From the 'oohs' to 'wow' and even whistles. Hattrick is a film that tells a story, creates immense mystery, has light moments and yet is simple.\\xa0The simplicity lies in the film's narration. Set in not more than three to four locations, the entire film travels deep into the characters' lives. As the story unravels, the audience will feel the shock, sadness and joy along with Farzad (Amir Jadidi), his wife Lida (Parinaz Izadyar), their friend Keivan (Saber Abar) and his girlfriend Raha (Mahoor Alvand).The main plot of Hattrick begins with the four friends on their way to their homes from a party when Farzad, who is driving, hits something or someone, yet chooses to drive away. They are engulfed with worry, guilt and even anger. What follows is just discussion that leads from one thing to another and brings in focus some uncomfortable truths and hypocrisy of the characters.\\xa0But\\xa0Hattrick\\xa0is not your everyday thriller which will keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Rather, it is an entertaining piece of cinema which conveys some serious messages without creating any tension. Like a funny instance when Lida, who is tired of husband's immaturity, keeps storming away from him in anger, and each of the time, Farzad quips- 'She will return'. Those instances were greeted with laughter by the audience, but all it showed was how Farzad had taken Lida for granted amidst all his follies and childish decisions. In fact, Amir Jadidi and Parinaz Izadyar play their characters to such perfection that even though one will find Farzad's emotions childlike and beautiful,\\xa0we hope Lida never returns to Farzad (keep an eye out for the scene where Farzad is engrossed in TV while in the background Raha and Keivan are involved in a serious discussion)At times, films that have nothing but only conversations tend to move at a slow pace, but not\\xa0Hattrick. With every conversation, the audience is clueless if it will be a serious revelation or a fun, everyday joke. Either of the two will definitely keep you glued to your seats till the very end.\\xa0All four main actors win every scene that is beautifully placed by Lavafi. Lavafi not only speaks volumes with small scenes, but he is successful in creating a lasting impression on the audience's mind with this masterpiece.\\xa0Hattrick\\xa0is a no-miss and totally worth a shot!Hattrick\\xa0will be screened at the BIFFES 2019 on February 28, Thursday at 4:20 pm at Screen 5.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday On the third day of the 11th Edition of the Bengaluru International Film festival, visitors turned up in large numbers and had an exciting line-up of film to catch up on. According to the Artistic Director of BIFFes, N Vidhyashankar, the weekend saw almost 15 to 20 thousand visitors thronging the PVR to watch a film.\\xa0Among almost 50 national, international and regional films a serpentine line was seen for films like The Guilty (from Denmark), Ranganayaki (a classic Ambareesh starrer Kannada film ) and 3 faces (from Iran) among several others on the third day of the festival.\\xa0Amidst the craze for these critically acclaimed films, visitors also found joy in finding out that food at the PVR cinema was served at slashed prices. \"The food prices are cut by almost 70%. We have picked the best selling food and cut down the prices for the visitors. The organisers want people to enjoy the festival to the fullest,\" a PVR staff said.\\xa0DH caught up with some of the visitors for their verdict on the first three days of the festival.\\xa0\"I did not come here on the first day, but the last two days have indeed felt like a festival,\" Dhruv, a literature student said. He rushed from one screen to another to watch films that he had been waiting for. \"I wanted to watch\\xa0The Burning\\xa0(a South Korean film) but missed it because my friend wanted to watch\\xa0The Wild Pear Tree. And then I caught with\\xa0Shoplifters\\xa0(a Japanese film). later on, in the day I managed to watch two more films, not fully though,\" Dhruv says who walked out of the screen before the films ended so that he could watch other films.\\xa0Though the visitors realise it is practically impossible to watch all the movies scheduled, they did not expect the crowd that welcomed them at every screen. Like Raagini P, a corporate communications executive had planned to watch\\xa0The Guilty\\xa0but had to settle for The Realm owing to a long line and filled the theatre. \"I think the BIFFes has attracted an amazing response. It is also the weekend crowd but not something I expected,\" Raagini says. Her friend, Sneha, a content writer agrees about the crowd and suggests multiple screenings of some of the popular films might help ease the crowd. \"Some popular films are lined up at the same time, maybe they could be screened again,\" she says. \"They could also create a list of \\'hist-list\\' of films the visitors could watch. Many of them are clueless about what to watch,\" Sneha adds.However, Raagini and Sneha like several others have no complaints about the kind of the genre of the scheduled films. \"The list caters to all kinds of film enthusiasts. I think it is a good mixture of all kinds of films,\" Raagini says.\\xa0They also have a suggestion to tackle the problem of visitors waiting in long lines for a film, but ending up reaching the door to a filled theatre. \"A facility to book slots online might solve so many problems. it will also give an idea to visitors and the organisers about the footfall,\" Raagini says.\\xa0\"The energy here is amazing. I love everything about the BIFFes except for the long line. Maybe next year they should have more venues to screen the films. Though a single venue is great, it is small for the number of people,\" Preeti, a techie said.\\xa0Sharath Kumar, a software professional feels it is natural and visitors should have patience. \"The quality of films, the variety and the convenience of being in one venue are the positives of BIFFes. Naturally, several people will come to enjoy the experience. We have to enjoy even the long lines, be civil in it and savour the fruit of patience- the films,\" he says.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Two days after the iconic Karachi Bakery in Indiranagar in East Bengaluru was in the spotlight after a group of \"patriots\" came and threatened to take out the name \"Karachi,\" the Hyderabad based Karachi Bakery clarified on Saturday that it was \"absolutely Indian.\"In a tweet @KarachiBakery, it said \"We would like to clarify that Karachi Bakery was founded by Shri. Khanchand Ramnani, who migrated to India during the partition. The brand was established in 1953 and is an Indian company based out of Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The popularity and love for its products has contributed to its growth throughout India and abroad. The essence of Karachi Bakery is absolutely Indian by heart and will remain so. We request everybody to refrain from any kind of misconceptions.\"#KarachiBakery pic.twitter.com/S5KHB7Nm0b— Karachi Bakery (@KarachiBakery) February 23, 2019Sections of the media reported even other outlets of Karachi Bakery in Bengaluru have also received threatening calls since February 17 from groups demanding that the firm should change its name or shut down the business, employees said. Employees at the company’s Mahadevapura outlet said that they had complained to the police about the calls.Nine people have been arrested by the Indiranagar police who have been booked for unlawful assembly, and criminal breach of trust. Among the nine, seven of them claimed that they were all social workers and were \"patriots\" locally, the police quoted them as saying.Meanwhile, the East division police also claim that they have been receiving calls stating the arrested men have affiliations with Right-wing outfits.Around 20 men, on Friday, had barged into the bakery and questioned as to why the bakery had such a name and also demanded to know who the owner was. However, they did not resort to damage property. The bakery staff had called the police after which they covered the word “Karachi” from the signage and even put a national flag in front of the bakery. The Indiranagar police have put up picketing near the outlet and other sensitive areas in the East division to avert such instances. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Within minutes of the ghastly terror attack at Lethpora in Pulwama, I got a call from my dad, who is currently camping in Srinagar. The tone was dejected, and very worried – a concern for my well-being in distant Bengaluru.“Furquan, be extra cautious, sentiments are going to be high. Don\\'t engage with anyone and make sure the rest of the family is also safe,\" he said.In pursuit of my daily story, I brushed away my father\\'s concerns thinking he had fallen prey to the hysteria. And I had a reason for that -- I have called Bengaluru my home for years and it\\'s my home and my identity. And I have never felt unwanted, much less hated, or unsafe here so far.MUST READ | Full Coverage on Pulwama Terror AttackThe next morning, when the nation was engrossed in the tragedy that had taken the lives of over 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans, everything seemed to be normal. But within hours of the cabinet committee on security (CCS) meeting, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi was speaking at the inauguration of Vande Bharat Express, his words at the public gathering in Varanasi sent shivers down my spine. \"Iss hamle ki vajah se desh mein jitna aakrosh hai, logon ka khoon khol raha hai; ye main bhalibhaanti samajh pa raha hoon. Iss samay jo desh ki apekshaen hain, kuchh kar guzarne ki bhavanaen hain, vo bhi s\\u200dvabhavik hain. (The rage in the country due to this attack is making the blood of the people boil; I understand this very well. At this time, there is also the feeling that something needs to be done. That’s also natural).”If my dad could anguish about what could be a ‘natural’ response to such a gruesome terror attack, the Prime Minister of 130 crore people, I thought, would also have an idea of it. Surprisingly, there was no appeal to maintain communal harmony at such a time -- and one still hasn’t come!Soon after the prime minister’s speech, a glimpse at Twitter feeds showed that my dad’s concerns no longer seemed so misplaced as it had earlier. It was not just Pakistan that was the target of hatred and anger, but also Kashmiri Muslims. Twitter was filled with comments spewing venom on the community. Former Infosys CFO and Modi’s camp follower T V Mohandas Pai tweeted: \"Kashmiri Shops in Tourists Spots -- Is there more than what meets the eye? Are such shops becoming money-laundering outfits? Needs investigation, worrisome\".In his tweet, Pai tagged Modi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, while quoting a link from Sanjeev Nayyar, who in an article on May 1, 2018, had tried to normalise the rape of a young Bakkarwal girl from Kathua. It is surprising that despite the backlash on Pai\\'s tweet, none of the ministers tagged have taken cognizance of it and come out with an appeal for calm.Social media is helping amplify anger and hate. The effects are evident on the streets. I am personally witnessing it. The security guard outside my home in Bengaluru who till three days ago used to greet me cheerfully every day had nothing but a cold, hateful stare in store for me. The driver of an autorickshaw I was travelling in was fine until he heard me talking over the phone in Kashmiri. His attitude changed immediately. The immediate, although not life-threatening consequence was a demand for Rs 20 more over the meter-fare. The man knew I could not afford to pick up a fight over it with him, now that I had exposed myself as a Kashmiri. I paid up without a murmur.Among the experiences of my Kashmiri friends, one sent me an SOS when her accommodation in a serviced apartment in a posh locality in Bengaluru got cancelled. The real estate agent sent her the following message: \"We will not provide the apartment to you and you know the reason\".In another case, a group of Kashmiri students pursuing graduate studies in the city was threatened, after a fellow Kashmiri college-mate, whose behaviour they had no connection with, put up a highly insensitive Facebook post over the February 14 terror attack.As I began to see the hate poison spreading, I tweeted: \"My heart and home are open to anyone in need of help. Please feel free to message me\". There was nothing political or communal in that tweet, but the right-wing Twitterati had to barge in. \"U mean any Muslim in need of help,\" replied one Kailash Chatterjee; another, by the Twitter, handle name of Daniel Semah tweeted: \"Say people who raped and butchered thousands of KPs in cold blood.\"Pardon my ignorance, but which among us Kashmiri Muslims have \"raped and butchered thousands of KPs in cold blood\". Not that I need to prove it to anyone, but I have been closer to Kashmiri Pandits than to Kashmiri Muslims for the most part of my life so far.\\nThe hate messages are not dying down with time, they are being ratcheted up in a calibrated manner even as the prime minister went from “I can understand people’s blood is boiling” on day 1 of the tragedy to “My blood is boiling” on day 3. So much so that I’m beginning to sweat at the thought of having to leave home for work. That, thousands of miles away from Kashmir, in Bengaluru. \\xa0\\n\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Students, teachers, lawyers, academics and rights activists from different groups and walks of life assembled together at Town Hall here on Saturday evening to protest against the Central Government’s ‘anti-student’ education policies and to extend solidarity to the ‘Dilli Chalo’ movement. \\xa0The programme began with a prayer and a minute of silence to pay respect to the soldiers who lost their lives in the Pulwama terror attack. Then, there were several speeches, slogans, songs and colourful placards that proclaimed their interest to ‘stop the communalisation, centralisation and commercialisation’ of education in India.Explaining to DH the reason for holding such a protest, Neenu Suresh, a research scholar of National Law School (NLS) and a member of the Bengaluru Collective, who along with the student group called the Student Outpost (TSO) organised the protest, said that their aim was to originally hold a seminar but then felt the need to protest to give students a voice.“It’s not actually a sudden thing and as we know in Karnataka, there is a limitation on student unions and protests here. So this meeting becomes all the more important. When students across the country have been protesting for the past five years against many different government measures such as slashing of scholarships, cutting of research grants and plans of scrapping the UGC, students of Bengaluru, which has many premier institutions of the country, felt that they must come out and show solidarity with other student struggles,” she argued.Shalom, an organising member of the TSO, also addressed the crowd whose composition included a wide range of local institutions and urged the students of Bengaluru to pull together to overturn the ban on student unions.“We, the students of Bengaluru, are afraid of politics and are apathetic to it. No student unions are allowed to represent our interests even though we have nominated councils that organise our college festivals. Until we don’t demand and ask our college management to grant us our rights, how do we expect to fight the government on bigger questions of justice? I urge you all to go back to your colleges and demand revocation of the student union ban,” \\xa0said Shalom.When questioned, other students cited other instances of government policies that prompted them to attend such an event.“Communalisation of education is attacking the very basis of knowledge and we have seen the willful distortion of history by the present government, which is encouraging dangerous trends such as Islamophobia and Casteism,” said Ardra, a 23-year-old student.Suvarat, a researcher at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), meanwhile, lamented that the fact the current government has not delivered on its promises on education.\\xa0\\n“They had pledged 6% GDP spending on education in their manifesto but what we saw was less than 3% in 2018. The other issue is that with increased privatisation, as is the case with the US where publicly taxpayer-funded research will continue to create breakthroughs but the profits and benefits will be passed on to the private players,” he argued.

       "  \"Get the best of news in your inbox everyday ‘Pakodanomics’, the right to work, unemployment data and student protests and movements were some of the themes on which students raised questions as they put their youth political leaders on the hot seat during a public meet on employment issues held here on Saturday.\\nA packed hall of students in Gandhi Bhavan’s Bapu Hall in Kumara Park kicked things off in the morning with political songs as they welcomed Gururaj Desai from the Student Federation of India (SFI), Surabhi Dwivedi from the National Students' Union of India (NSUI) and Ashish Chauhan from Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) to start the first panel discussion.Asha Kotwal of the All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch (AIDMAM), the moderator of the first session, began the discussion by asking the speakers to express their views on the recent row over the ‘leaked’ National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) data which has pegged India’s unemployment rate at 6.1% during the 2017-2018 period.In her opening remarks, Surabhi from NSUI condemned the government for its attempt at data suppression and asserted that the youth of the country is frustrated and “fed-up” with the government’s “fake promises”.\\n“We have a Prime Minister who advocates for Pakodanomics. At the risk of being charged for sedition, I’d like to ask, How’s the josh? Where are the jobs?” she questioned.\\n\\xa0However, Chauhan retorted by underplaying the issue as he argued that the problem of unemployment is not unique to us and is happening all over the world.\\n“We are debating one report which is not even officially released yet. If you see the International Labor Organisation (ILO) reports, it has pegged the official unemployment rate at around 3.6-3.7 %. Our economic growth in the past five years has been tremendous while inflation has halved. Meanwhile, there are crores of jobs that have been created according to EPF data. We can further improve the employment situation by implementing the Kothari Commission recommendations and strengthening Mahatma Gandhi’s ideas of ‘Bunyadi’ (Foundational) education,” asserted Chauhan.\\n\\xa0Ashish’s statistics were then rebutted by Desai of SFI who claimed that according to central government data, 1.15 crore youth pass out of colleges every year but only around 5 Lakh manage to find employment.“Instead of adding employment to education and healthcare, the Modi government is experimenting with us through contractual employment wherein temporary workers with no job security get paid half of what the permanent workers are paid for doing for the same amount of work. Modi and Rahul Gandhi have both made a lot of statements and though ‘surgical strikes’, ‘acche din’ and ‘beti bachao’ are catchy slogans, the youth shouldn’t be swayed,“ he argued.\\xa0During the question-answer round with the students, speakers were questioned about how their political parties plan to improve the employment situation in India.\\xa0Dwivedi from NSUI said that some suggestions by Congress in light of upcoming elections included advocating for creating a student right’s commission on the lines of the national women’s commission and granting of unemployment allowances while Desai argued for employment to be guaranteed and strengthened as a fundamental right.\\n\\xa0The audience also broke into raucous laughter at one point during the Q & A when Chauhan from NSUI was asked by a student as to when PM Modi will be sending Rs 15 Lakh to his bank account and when the Ganga will be cleaned.\\xa0Chauhan responded to the question by saying that the government is making efforts to bring back illicit cash that is stashed abroad. He then asserted that the Ganga has been cleaned which again invited hysterical laughter from the crowd.\\n“I went to Prayagraj on the occasion of Vasant Panchami and I assure you that you can take a dip at the Triveni Sangam. Why are Siberian birds coming back to India after decades? Did PM \\xa0Modi send them Visas?” he asked.\\n\\xa0Another panel discussion on student movements was also held post lunch. The panel discussions were organized by Azim Premji University’s Centre for Sustainable Employment and Samvada, a collective that works on youth issues. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Antinatalism is gradually gaining ground in the city. As many as 40 people came together on Sunday morning calling upon the public to opt for a child-free life.Members of Child-Free India gathered in front of the Mantri Mall, Malleswaram\\xa0and pledged a child-free life. Stating that procreation was wrong, the antinatalists said human misery could be avoided if people simply did not exist in\\xa0the first place.Pratima Naik, an engineering graduate from Bengaluru who helped to make the group\\'s first national meet a reality, said those born into our miserable world are doomed to suffer. According to her, new people are also capable of inflicting pain on the rest.\"Being born means to suffer, as well as feeling pleasure. But the foregoing of pleasure is not as bad as the presence of suffering. Therefore, it is nothing but ideal for humanity to stop reproducing and go extinct,\" she said.Prasanth, another member of the group, said the participants told everyone why they were opting for a child-free life and the reasons for the same.\"Humans are creating a lot of problems for\\xa0themselves\\xa0and\\xa0other species. More humans will accelerate the degradation of society and the environment,” he said.Pratima has created a Facebook page - Child-free India - with more than 380 followers. The page carries regular posts on antinatalism.Sunday\\'s meet is part of a series of preparatory events to make antinatalism popular. The meeting ended with the committee drafting a set of resolutions that will provide a basis for the movement to convince young people who are willing to think deeper about issues related to life and suffering.In a release, the group said a core team has been formed to decide how to expand the network by spreading awareness in various metros.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday A newly designed handheld Braille converter is making life easy for the blind.Now, the blind can walk into a library, pick up a book of their choice and allow the converter to transcribe it for them.The device, BBook, which converts text into Braille real-time, is the brainchild of two Computer Science Engineering students -- Rohit N and Ruchitha D J—belonging to Bengaluru’s MVJ College.Inventors of the device explained that the scarcity of Braille books –less than 1% of the printed books are transcribed into Braille- as the major reason behind designing the converter.Braille books are heavy and unwieldy, they point out. For instance, a 500-page Braille book weighs at least four kilos. Moreover, they cost ten times more than regular books.Hooked to the internet, the BBook can also download news articles and magazines and transcribe them for the user’s benefit.“Characters are picture-mapped and converted to Braille,” Rohit told DH, adding that the device allows the blind to access books that remained out of reach for them.Besides the hard copy, BBook can convert even digital materials. “These could either be in PDF or Word format,” Rohit said. “Digital books can be converted letter-by-letter.”The Braille converter was among several products on display at the Visweswaraya Industrial and Technological Museum on Saturday.“Initially, we weren’t sure if the product would make a difference. We visited Sri Rakum School for the Blind in Indiranagar and interacted with the teachers. With their encouragement, we took two months to work on the converter,” Rohit said.They tested the proto-type of the product with the blind students of Rakum School. “The students have suggested some minor changes and we’re working on it. Once the product is ready to be marketed, we expect its price to be below Rs 5,000,” Rohit said. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

Further on, they are painted upon with beautiful art, doodles and motifs, accompanied by inspiring messages. The area around the walls would otherwise be misused by the public, especially to urinate in the open and dump garbage. The ‘Paint for a Cause ‘ project is an initiative by Smileys India, a volunteer organisation that started functioning in 2015, with an aim to support NGOs and government\\xa0structures\\xa0through the medium of art.\\xa0The volunteers are set to restore the Brahma Kumari Road in Koramangala - a stretch rundown with garbage dumped near the walls. The restoration effort,\\xa0titled the Dyudle Art movement, is being organised in collaboration with the Dyu Art Cafe. The idea is to beautify the street walls of Koramangala in the coming weeks.“Now, people have stopped spitting and urinating. They are taking selfies instead, standing along the painted footpath and chatting. This is a welcome change and the very intent behind the whole project,” says Vidushi Jayaswal speaking about the success of the project. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

Nevertheless, the problem lies in the management of cancer and not the disease.”According to the National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR), around 2.25 million people are living with cancer in the country.Shortage of doctorsLack of specialist doctors seems to be affecting the non-communicable disease (NCD) programme initiated by the state government at various NCD clinics across the state.According to health department officials, there is a shortage of doctors, especially specialist, who could run the NCD centres. At the moment, there are at least 50% vacancies waiting to be filled.The NCD clinics were started to provide awareness about lifestyle diseases like hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer. The health staff at the clinics screen patients for these diseases and refer them to larger health centres for further treatment. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

However, the general public should do their part to become active players in upholding safety on the road,\" he said.Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) Alok Kumar expressed concern over commuters bypassing traffic rules. \"The use of mobile phones while driving is banned. But people still use it via Bluetooth devices. Many try to get away by not wearing helmets and hardly anyone follows lane discipline,\" he said.The number of accidents in Bengaluru have come down from about 7,500 in 2016 to about 4,600 last year. The fatalities, which had reduced to 642 in 2017 from 793 in 2016, went up again last year to 684.The transport department also released a mini book on road safety for children, which contained illustrated examples of the dos and don\\'ts while using the roads. A road safety brochure was also distributed among the participants.Police inspectors from Hebbal, Magadi, Jayanagar, Madiwala and Ulsoor were felicitated for their performance.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday An app developed by two teenaged brothers to detect a defect in the eye has won the Grand Prize at the IRIS National Fair, India’s largest research-based science fair for students.Vrishab Krishna and Vishwesh Krishna, both students of National Public School, Indiranagar, will now represent India at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.Their app, Kanna, is a result of the brothers’ mission to ensure that a defect in children’s eyes does not go undetected. The teens claim to have come up with the solution after Vrishab had Amblyopia as a young boy.When Vrishab was four and his brother Vishwesh two years older set out to play, the elder sibling would catch a ball that was thrown at him with ease. However, Vrishab, unlike most children of his age, would be left perplexed. When children his age could just run down the stairs, Vrishab would watch every step and take longer.Multiple visits to ophthalmologists yielded no results. His mother Gayathri Krishna was told that he had long sight and that it would be fine as he grew older. She refused to buy the explanations of the doctors.“I noticed that in a few photographs, he was cross-eyed. When Vrishab was in second year Montessori, he was exceptionally nervous when he was asked to write,” she recalled.She took him to a Bengaluru-based paediatric ophthalmologist who diagnosed Vrishab with Amblyopia.This is a condition where one eye functions better than the other. In other terms, one of them is a lazy eye. “One optic nerve is dominant over the other. The brain takes one set of signals. Over time, the other tends to become blind,” she said.Simply applying a patch on the lazy eye and having the other eye to do the functioning is a solution. However, early detection is the key.Kanna, the app developed by the boys ensures early detection, claim the teenagers. Users can just upload a passport-size picture on the app, which will soon be available online. With image processing and machine learning techniques, the app can identify the potential risk factors and hence, possible cases with just a picture from the smartphone. The boys are running a validation with data from 600 cases from Shankara Eye Hospital.“We hope to take it to rural eye camps where we can identify other kids early. Children ought to be detected before the age of eight, failing which it could result in blindness. Conventional methods are time-consuming and we can pick those with risk factors better,” said Vrishabh. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

On Friday, 12 candidates, claiming to be the former students of Vogue Institute, who gave up the course for various reasons, alleged that the management was not returning their academic documents nor refunding the fees, and making them to run to pillar to post from past six months. They protested in front of the administrative office along with the support of Akhila Bharata Vidyarthi Parishat (ABVP) and took the assurance in written format from the management in the late night, after they called off the protest.Vogue Institute of Fashion Technology on further clarified on the allegations made by the students on approval of All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) for the newly started courses. On Friday the members of Akhila Bharata Vidyarthi Parishat (ABVP) and students (claiming to be the former students of the institute) alleged that the college has not got valid approval from AICTE to start PGDM courses.Dr M M Kariappa, Founder and Chairman of Vogue Institute of Fashion Technology clarified that among 12 people who turned up, 11 of them are their students, who have attended the classes, practical examinations and internals held in December in their college. “There was one student who was also demanding to settle her dues. We remember returning her documents and refunding her fees long back. Rest of the students were very much part of our institution, and all of sudden on Friday they turned up protesting to return their documents. Even to return the document, there is a procedure to follow. How is it possible to return the documents and refund the fees in one day?,” asks Kariappa, by showing the valid proof of the affiliation for his institution from All India Council For Technical Education (AICTE).Cariappa surfaced the documents of getting approval from AICTE in April 2018. \"Ours is 23 year old institution, without valid approval its impossible to start any course. In April 2018, we got the approval for the PGDM course,\" Cariappa told DH, by surfacing the documents of getting approval from AICTE. He further added that these are all intended to tarnish the image of his institution. \"Students have been misguided by some people for their political and personal gains,\" he added.\\xa0Asked him the reason behind the protest, Kariappa said, “I think these students have been misused by someone to their personal or political gains. I feel pity for them as they are spoiling their precious life. If at all they are demanding the settlement from past six months what is necessary for them to attend the class or take up the internals and practical examinations conducted by our college. So there is someone behind this, who is intended to tarnish the image of our institution and spoil students’ future.”The very first batch of the Vogue Institute’s PGDM program was commenced with 39 students. Since one person opted out after a week of the classes started, the strength was reduced to 38.A student, who is performing PGDM in Vogue also confirmed that those students were very much part of the class till Friday. “I don’t know what happened all of a sudden they were very much part of our classes. All of sudden we were shocked to see them protesting. What ever the allegations they are making are baseless. We have well qualified faculties and resource persons,” a student told DH.

Our aim was to revive the lake and make it a biodiversified hotspot.”The EFI team carried out the restoration work at the lake over the past four months.

For January, the normal maximum and minimum were 28 and 16 degrees Celsius, respectively.Geeta Agnihotri, director-in-charge, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Bengaluru, said many days experienced cold spell this season when compared to previous years.It was not just because of the winds, but also due to the local factors like the creation of heat islands and dry lands, she added.C S Patil, director-in-charge, IMD Bengaluru, said the northerly winds were less this season. Winter will continue till February. But gradually the temperature will rise.Geeta and Patil said the light rainfall, up to 0.8 mm, in isolated places across the state, which occurred during the end of January, had no impact on the winter spell because of a trough.However, the weathermen have hinted that the summer heat could be high in the coming season.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The Institute of Wood Science and Technology (IWST) has partnered with schools to tap people at the right age and sow the seeds of conservation.The IWST has tied up with Kendriya Vidyalaya (KV) and Navodaya Vidyalaya (NV) schools in Bengaluru to promote awareness about forests and environment.The MoU has been named ‘Prakriti’ and is the result of the partnership agreement inked between the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education in partnership with Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangha and Navodaya Vidyalaya Sangathan.Pankaj K Aggarwal, scientist, extension, IWST, told DH that for the first time an MoU has been signed with schools.The idea is to familiarise students about wood science, the museum, usage of wood and its importance. The aim is to also provide a platform for children to learn practical skills towards judicious use of wood.Inaugurated in 2012, the museum-cum-interpretation centre is one of its kind in Karnataka and receives around 2,500 people annually, mostly school and architecture students.At the museum, students can touch and feel the various types of woods, see the various colours, understand how to study the age of a tree and even know the tree’s history better. The museum also has a tree disc which traces the time since the British came to India until Independence.“Schools approach us individually to visit the museum when they get to know. But now we are tying up with them. In the first phase it is KV and NV. Gradually we will also tie up with private schools since educational tours are now a part of the curriculum,” he said.The IWST is also organising an awareness programme for children studying in classes VI-VIII in February.To reach out to the masses better, IWST has also decided to re-visit its two-year-old proposal of adding the museum to the city’s tourism map.N Mohan Karnat, director, IWST, said: “A proposal was made two years ago but it did not materialise. Now we are requesting the government and tourism department so that more visitors, especially students, can come. We are also working on adding more wood polymer made products in the museum to showcase innovations.” Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

Several Gandhians, including those staying near the Wardha Ashram, visited Lalbagh on the last day of the flower show.But the Horticulture Department and the volunteers found it difficult to instil Gandhi’s message of cleanliness as visitors to the botanical garden littered the place with plastic bottles and carry bags. A mountain of plastic items was seen strewn around the place, despite a ban on their use.Lalbagh’s Deputy Director Chandrashekar M R said the department penalised 50 violators over the last 10 days and collected Rs 5,000 in fine. He insisted that the aim was to create awareness and not to punish people.The department had collected Rs 5,000 as deposit from the vendors who set up stalls at the flower show, which it would return if the area around the stalls is maintained well. But it would retain the deposit money and would levy further penalties if the stalls do not ensure the space is clean by January 28. Also, despite high security, the department was unable to keep away hawkers and illegal vendors who did brisk business at the garden.Official records reveal that the department collected Rs 29.22 lakh from 78,150 visitors on Sunday. Over the last 10 days, the department earned Rs 1,55,29,590 from the sale of tickets to 4,02,700 visitors. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

The BMS has partnered with the Electronics City for the project.Mulukutla said an average of the data collected is derived every 15 minutes and is used to understand seasonal, peak period and day variations.Unlike other studies, the BMS aims to overlay multiple factors on the data such as the traffic count, traffic management and health count and see if congestion in the city could be brought down. The BMS executive said the data will be gradually shared with the government, citizens and the companies to help decide such things as work timings, shifts, commute time, school timings, signal optimisation, parking management among other things.The team has set a one-year timeline to collect data, draw inferences and do the analysis.They say they are currently in the first stage.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday A consumer court has ordered a private hospital to pay Rs 26 lakh as compensation to a couple for medical negligence.The hospital was found guilty of negligence and deficient service while offering a specialised treatment to the pregnant woman who allegedly had a miscarriage as a result. Her husband made special efforts to learn the medical terminology to argue the case party-in-person at the consumer court.The couple, T H M Jagadeesha and his wife Sandhya reside in Kodichikkanahalli and work as software engineers in the city. Sandhya had two miscarriages since 2011, the first happening six weeks after conception and the second after 14 weeks.While looking for the specialised treatment to have a baby, Jagadeesha came across Cloudnine hospital on the internet. “The hospital claimed zero mortality and 99.72% survival rate of the babies. Its webpage also showed one Dr Leela Bhagavan as senior most consultant obstetrician and Gynecologist,” Jagadeesha said.The couple met Dr Leela Bhagavan and described the medical history. Sandhya was put on medication.In his complaint to the court, Jagadeesha said the doctor ignored watery discharge, lower backache, pulling sensation and bleeding, all within nine days of Sandhya’s conception.\\xa0The complainant said the treatment lasted for 21 weeks and ended in miscarriage in June 2014. Right from the time she conceived, Sandhya has been visiting Dr Leela throughout the treatment period.In June 2014, Sandhya went to the hospital complaining discharge. The doctor ruled out infection and said it was due to poor hygiene. But when the condition did not improve eight days later, the doctor admitted there was infection and prescribed another medicine.On June 21, 2014, Sandhya was admitted to the hospital with severe backache and underwent a surgery.Jagadeesha said the doctor did not possess the requisite skills to deal with fertility and pregnancy issues. She promoted the medicines of a chain-linked company whose products are not approved by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. He also alleged that there was negligence on the part of the doctor and the hospital while examining the patient.The court held that the fact of the doctor’s qualification not being recognised by the MCI was evident when the hospital removed her qualification on its website after the issue came to light.“The doctor was aware of the fact that the patient had two abortions earlier and had a high risk,” the court noted.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The Karnataka High Court on Thursday issued notices to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and the state government over the inaction of the public sector banks in issuing demand drafts (DD) against cash payments unless the customers had bank accounts.The court was hearing a PIL challenging the same. A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy was hearing a petition filed by advocate Ramesh Naik.Naik moved court seeking directions to all the public sector and commercial banks to follow\\xa0their own direction pertaining to the ‘issue and payment for demand drafts’, and not to create hardship for the customer by insisting him/her to have a mandatory bank account or demanding only cheques for issuing demand drafts up to any amount less than Rs 50,000.The petitioner contended that a large number of\\xa0people are facing hardship when transacting\\xa0at public sector banks in their effort to get DDs for even small amounts like Rs 100, 200, 500 or 1000.On December 24, 2018, the petitioner, in order to ascertain this, had tried to obtain a demand draft for a small amount of Rs 100 in favour of the ‘District Consumer Redressal Forum’ by visiting a few public sector banks. All of them refused to issue the DD stating cash payment cannot be accepted, and the amount should be paid by cheque or the customer should have an account.The petitioner further added that RBI ‘Master Direction - Know your Customer (KYC) Direction 2016’, provides for the acceptance of cash payments of any amount less than Rs 50,000 for issuing demand drafts.The petitioner also told the court that The State Bank of India agreed to issue a DD for the amount of Rs 100, after he complained in writing to the manager of the concerned bank.The DD was issued on submission of the petitioner’s Aadhar card, while\\xa0refusing to accept any other identity proof.The petitioner, on December 26, 2018, submitted a representation via e-mail to the jurisdictional banking ombudsman designated for the purpose by the RBI, explaining the issue, and requesting to address the grievance faced by people in obtaining a DD. However no action was taken.Thereafter the petitioner submitted a representation via e-mail again to the Indian Banks’ Association which again resulted in no response, following which the petitioner approached the court. The court has adjourned the hearing. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

But there are a lot of irregularities in the procedure. Though there are no vacancies, senior BU officials are showing filled up seats as vacant, and have invited applications for the positions,” the protesters alleged.According to the protesters, though the deputy chief minister, Dr G Parameshwara, had ordered the VC to conduct an inquiry and stop the recruitment, the BU has openly invited the applications.“As there were allegations on BU officials over giving wrong information to the social welfare department, the\\xa0deputy chief minister had ordered to freeze the recruitment.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The child lock feature has been disengaged in 42,000 out of 2.5 lakh cabs in the state, the government submitted to the high court on Wednesday.In the next three months, the feature would be removed from the remaining cabs, it added.A division bench headed by Acting Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy was hearing the public interest litigation filed by Bangalore Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology seeking directions to the authorities concerned to disable the system in cabs in the wake of crimes being committed against women travelling in cabs.In the last hearing, the government had told the court that it had issued notices to the cab aggregators to deactivate the feature in taxis.The petitioner had filed the petition after being aggrieved by the inaction of the authorities in ensuring the safety of women travelling in cabs in Bengaluru and other parts of the state.The petitioner had contended that the child safety locks are built into the rear doors of most cars to prevent the rear seat passengers from opening the door while in motion, and this feature has been in existence since the 1980s in most cars. The intent was to provide the driver with a safe method to prevent children from opening the door, the petitioner said.The feature gets activated when one gets into the car. Once in the car, it is impossible for the passenger to open the door and run out in case of an emergency. The passenger is trapped inside and is at the mercy of the driver.The petitioner had further contended that despite increasing crimes against women in the city, the government and the authorities concerned have failed to take any action.Following the submission of the state to disengage the lock from the remaining cabs, the court disposed of the petition.

At 1 pm,\\xa0a fire was spotted opposite to the Pariksha Bhavan (examination block), which gutted at least 10 acres of land in the campus. Though the fire brigade was immediately rushed to the spot, they struggled to put the fire out until late evening.“This is not a wildfire. As there are a lot of dry leaves and grasses around the campus, some might have thrown a lit\\xa0cigarette or lighted match stick. This would have set ablaze the dry leaves, only to be fanned by the hot sun and the afternoon wind. This is the fourth such incident this month,” a senior fire official told DH.As Tuesday was declared a government holiday, the regular traffic inside the campus was missing. Student and faculty were not present in the campus, which helped avoid a major mishap.As a precautionary measure, BU is housing a fire brigade to cater to the surrounding areas in the huge campus in order to avoid further fire accidents.“This is common this season. During the summer, our campus is more prone to such incidents. So, we have a fire brigade in place. Just like the wildfire is natural, some incidents are man-made,” a senior BU official told DH.

We will collect data along with the facial recognition of the homeless people in an app which will be developed soon.”“Since the homeless people are often wanderers, we have to track them to take care of them in the urban centres. The app will store their photos, name and the centre or place where they have to stay,” he added.The Supreme Court in 2010 directed all the state governments to set up shelters for the homeless, especially in towns with a population of 1 lakh and more.The urban homeless survey by the BBMP along with Dream India Network and Impact India Consortium was completed in three major zones of the city in December 2018. Officials identified close to 1,200 urban homeless in the East zone itself. South and West are the other two zones where the survey was completed.The civic body has also identified 1,526 homeless people in the West zone and at least 2,200 in the South. The BBMP is planning to set up around 40 permanent shelters across the city for the homeless people by next winter.

We found that during events in daytime the decibel level is higher than the noise level standard stipulated for the residential area.”Satya Achayya, who is residing in the Nandidurga extension for the past 10 years, said: “It is not just music from the palace premises.

Our complaints to the authorities concerned have gone in vain.”The KSPCB official said they have issued the notice and requested the palace management to take measure to reduce the sound.\"We have also instructed them to arrange event inside the auditorium as the programmes are conducted outside that create noise in the neighbourhood,” the KSPCB official said.\\'Not much of noise\\'Responding to the allegations, V K Bhat, senior manager of Jayamahal palace said: “There is not so much of the noise from the hotel.

We have banned bursting of the crackers on the premises, but the crackers sound which residents are complaining about is from the palace ground,” he added. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday To increase biodiversity in the city, especially Bangalore University, the varsity syndicate has directed each department to create a bio-diversity park.Vice-Chancellor of Bangalore University K R Venugopal on Thursday said the syndicate has earmarked 50 acres to Botany department and 10 acres to each department to create bio-diversity parks.From 1974, when 1,111 acres were allocated to the University, only 500 acres now remain with it. So every department will have to take the responsibility to create the park and protect it, Venugopal said while speaking at the inauguration of a day-long workshop on “Traditional Knowledge as Intellectual Property Right- Documentation and Scope for Patent Protection,” organised by Karnataka Biodiversity Board (KBB) and Botany Department.The aim of the workshop was to interact with researchers, lecturers and students on the importance of biodiversity, research and patents.Faced with a shortage of trained lecturers and researchers, Venugopal said the pressure is now on students to work individually. He said the matter will be discussed with the education minister after the Belagavi Session ends.Chairman of the Department of Environmental Sciences R K Somashekar used the platform to call government organisations, including KBB, to help create and protect bio-diversity parks. He requested KBB to look at universities and researchers for work, instead of agencies, for their projects.Somashekar pointed that the problem with patenting traditional knowledge is that Indians are very slow when compared to other countries, like increase of turmeric and Basmati rice. This is despite the fact that 80% of medicines researched and sold are brain-child of Indian pharmaceutical companies and farmers.KBB member secretary Virender Singh said traditional knowledge is available since long but is highly misused. The Board is now interacting with communities to accumulate data and patent it.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

We know that we do not have direct access to him. We united the youngsters for the movement to bring someone we sincerely look up to through a social media movement,\" said Anto Philip, co-founder of Under 25.The main flagship property of the company is the ‘Under 25 Summit’, India’s largest youth festival. The summit has been held in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi and Hyderabad and a total of 30,000 people have participated in five years.Across two days, the Under 25 Summit 2019 will have multiple specifically curated workshops and experience zones with over 80 speakers and more than 15,000 attendees.‘Dear Obama’ is an open letter from youngsters across India to Obama in the form of a video.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The research scholars of the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, TIFR, Bangalore, who are protesting against the discrimination in the allocation of funds for PhD and postdoctoral scholars, have demanded an 80% hike on the current fellowship.The students who are protesting have appealed to the Department of Atomic Energy, HRD ministry, principal scientific advisors for initiation, increment and regularisation of fellowship for all research scholars.“During the last few years, public spending in higher education and in particular research in basic sciences and humanities have gradually declined, which is adversely resulting in high drop-out rates and increasing brain drain. This also affects India’s research ecosystem as well as scientific technologies,” students expressed their concerns by adding that 70% of the scholars in the country are severely discriminated, and the majority of them are not having a fellowship at all.In the letter, the research scholars have also explained the current pay scales at different government institutes and R&Ds. “The existing fellowships were last revised in October 2014 on a promise of periodic revisions every three to four years. As of date, neither the fellowship have been revised nor has been any such announcements made,” the letter added.By highlighting the loopholes, the research scholars have raised few demands, which mainly urges to fix the various problems arising while awarding the fellowship.All scholars must be entitled to dignified fellowship without any discrimination, which will be disbursed on a regular monthly basis, and to be revised on a yearly\\nbasis.The disparity of postdoctoral fellowship across institution must be eliminated and 80% increase in the amount, which is been currently awarded, fee reduction in different research institutes and universities, and provide adequate infrastructure and funding for research in humanities and basic science.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

In the past few years, cracks have appeared on the existing track, and in some areas the track is sliding away, causing difficulty for the regulars.To arrest the sliding of the track, the civic body has planned to strengthen the tank bund by incorporating gabion boxes. The gabion box technology is used to strengthen bunds, and shores up well against erosion.“Three sides of the lake are used by walkers and joggers every day. In few areas, there are slides, which have damaged the walker’s track.\\xa0Hence we have planned to repair,”\\xa0Jagannath Rao, BBMP’s deputy conservator of forests told DH.“We will first place gabion boxes, upon which we will construct the walker’s path. The gabion boxes will avoid slides and erosion. We have taken up the work in the west bank of the lake already, and the work will start soon in the eastern and southern banks,” he added.Once the modern walker’s\\xa0track is completed, a bridge connecting the east and west bank will be constructed. Sankey Tank was built in 1882 by the British officer Richard Sankey, to meet the water supply demands of the city. On an average, Sankey Tank attracts around 2,000 fitness enthusiasts daily.“The main reason for the damage on the pathway is constant water current and erosion over a period of time, which led to the weakening of the wall,” explained Jagannath Rao.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

Many refuse to obtain a gender certificate because of the embarrassment, though it helps us get recognition.”\\xa0An in-house census says of the 7,000 LGBTQs in the city, a meagre 250 have obtained gender certificates. Many working at government and private sectors refuse to come out due to social stigma, said Julian, a participant.“We are unable to get government jobs, rental accommodation or bank loans. After the court order, many private organisations have sacked their employees on learning about their identities,” Kumar added.‘I have no friends’Cosmetology student Riyana said people distance themselves once they come to know her real identity. “I have no friends in college,” she said. “It’s very difficult to continue my part-time job on many days. Even the police ill-treat us. The promise of awareness programmes to sensitise people hasn’t happened,” Riyana said.While the state conducts training programmes like tailoring and beautician courses through its departments, getting jobs or financial aid even from the government is impossible.The government has not yet called the association members to understand their demands and issues, said Yash, an organiser and participant.Their demands include full implementation of the SC verdict, sensitising the LGBTQIA community and the private sector, implementation of the Karnataka transgender policy,\\xa0 2017 and review of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Hundreds of Bengalureans from Mahadevapura marched in solidarity on Sunday, in support of the migrant workers who were evicted from slums in the area.Last week, the slum dwellers in Thubarahalli and Kundalahalli near Bellandur were forcefully evicted from their sheds at the behest of the local MLA, Arvind Limbavali.\\xa0As\\xa0the police stood guard, a small portion of the labour sheds at Munnekolala labour camp were razed. Thereafter, the homeless had to seek refuge in the neighbouring sheds, under the trees and out in the open.Most of the migrant workers are from different parts of Karnataka, including Hassan, Bidar and parts of north Karnataka. Some are from Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Citizens under the banner ‘Bengaluru for Thubarahalli and Kundalahalli’, took out the solidarity march.“The slum dwellers are the people that build our apartments, metros, roads; they have in fact built Bengaluru. They are the underprivileged who have left their villages and come here to earn a living. There are plenty of corporate staff in Bengaluru, why are we not kicking them out?” asked Vijayakumar Seethappa, a member of the Karnataka Janaarogya Chaluvali.\\xa0“We are supporting the poor with humanity. We do not want to witness sectarian violence, and the city being divided,” Seethappa said. According to Seethappa, those who claim that illegal migrants live in our city’s slums have ‘vested interests’.“We had challenged the BBMP’s demolitions, and\\xa0recently the stay order was given to restore the houses. We will stand by them and support them,” said Umesh, another supporter.\\xa0\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

However, with the help of doctors from the city, his lower jaw was naturally reconstructed harvesting his bone and stem cells.Hussain could not close his mouth and had difficulty in swallowing due to lack of skeletal support. Despite undergoing multiple reconstructive surgeries and visiting various countries for the same, he finally found some relief at the Manipal Hospital in Malleswaram.Nisha Shetty, consultant Facio Maxillary surgeon at the hospital who treated Hussain said,”\\xa0Hussain’s previous surgeries left very little opportunity for us. He had undergone grafting, both fibulaes (lower limbs) were used\\xa0and multiple soft tissue grafts were harvested to perform surgeries; it was difficult to reconstruct his jaw again,” she added.After thorough planning, the doctors from Manipal Hospital used 3D scanning and printing to reconstruct the mandible. With the help of\\xa0Hussain’s stem cells, hip bone (illium) and bone graft impregnated into a 3D printed model, a customised prefabricated mandible was fixed to his residual bone.Hussain was 17 when he lost his jawbone in a blast, and had\\xa0undergone 9 surgeries across the globe. After 3 years, he visited Manipal hospital where his mandible was naturally reconstructed using his stem cells. Hussain had to wait for\\xa0three months for his mandible to grow.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday City residents and tourists alike can now enjoy the breathtaking vista around the 1,400-year-old Yediyur Lake in South Bengaluru, as the BBMP launches boating services on the famous waterbody.Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun on Saturday inaugurated the eco-friendly boat rides on the historic lake, which attracts several migratory birds during the winter. Yediyur becomes the second lake in the city after Madiwala to have boating services.For Rs 50, visitors will get half-an-hour of boating on the lake’s clear waters. To avoid noise that could disturb the winged visitors, the BBMP has banned motorised boats.“The noise of the motorboats can unsettle the migratory birds and the diesel spill could pollute the lake. So, we are only using the pedal boats,” said N R Ramesh, husband of corporator Poornima Ramesh.The corporator said a youth organisation — Kuvempu Yuvakara Sangha — bought the boats for Rs 12 lakh and is paying Rs 60,000 annual rent to the BBMP to operate the boats on the lake.Given the lake’s strong Hoysala connections, it is named after the famous queen of that dynasty Shantala Devi, who, as claimed by an inscription, bathed in its waters. All the eight boats in the lake have also been named after various Hoysala kings.Children below 15 are not allowed without adult supervision, while the use of plastic, smoking and consumption of alcohol are also banned near the waterbody.

We have, in the past, had discussions with the education department on imposing restricts on the number of hours a child spends playing such games. We want the police to also play an active role and take precautions to ensure measures are put in place to ensure children do not play such games,” KAMS stated.The game involves players fighting each other with weapons and the one who survives at the end is the winner. What begins as a game lasting about 30 minutes, keeps a player hooked on for several hours, leading to addiction, experts warn.Dr Manoj Kumar Sharma from the SHUT Clinic, Nimhans, said that five out of eight cases that are referred to them is related to PUBG addiction.“They are between the 16 to 20 age group. When we speak to them they explain that better graphics and interface is a reason they chose this game over the others,” Dr Sharma said.These students said that they have been playing the game for 10-12 hours. “This leads to disturbance in the morning schedule, has an impact on food habits, academic life is affected and withdrawal leads to aggression,” Dr Sharma said, while adding that whether PUBG as a game was leading to aggression is yet to be ascertained.“Schools should issue advisory to students about positive lifestyle. They must be cautioned against excessive gaming. Parents should check if kids are using it for too long,” Dr Sharma added.Meanwhile, Dr Bhujang Shetty, chairman, Narayana Nethralaya, said, “Staring into any electronic gadget for too long leaves children with a high risk of myopia.It could also cause stress to the eye. Hence there is a need to curb it,” Dr Shetty warned. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

Therefore, we used the leadless pacemaker for this patient,\" he said.“Compared to the traditional pacemaker which costs around Rs 1.5 lakh, the leadless pacemaker costs close to Rs 10 lakh. Moreover, this technology was introduced just 2 years\\xa0ago. The patient withstood the procedure well and did not experience any unconsciousness post implant. In comparison to a conventional pacemaker, the new-age leadless pacemaker eliminates the need for a surgical pocket, there is no visible pacemaker device under a patient\\'s chest skin, no incision scar on the chest, no connector wires or lead, and no restrictions on any daily activities.“ added Dr Shashidhar.Conventional pacemakers are surgically placed under the skin of the patient with the help of wires stretching from veins on the arms to the heart, which can further cause complications. Whereas in the leadless pacemaker, the patient does not experience any discomfort, infections, device complications\\xa0or\\xa0dysfunction.\\xa0The conventional pacemakers weighs about 30 to 40 gm whereas the leadless pacemaker weighs only 2 gm with 0.8 cc volume.

We have requested the government to pass an order in this regard,” he told DH but refused to reveal more details stating that it will be announced by the chief minister.Sources said about 250 movies may be screened during the festival and popular films may get as much time and space as the serious ones. Asked about the prominence of popular movies, Chandrashekhar said the festival will be balanced in its approach.“Both art cinema and popular movies will go hand in hand considering that the film industry supports these events. However, the emphasis is on aesthetics and there is no compromise. We have looked at the format of film festivals across the world. Besides the popular ones, there will be several movies in regional, national, Asian and international categories,” he said.No fest in MysuruChandrashekhar said the film festival will not be extended to Mysuru. “Many organisations from different towns have come, seeking to hold a film festival in their places as well. While I believe in taking movies to villages, Biffes is not the right event for that. Instead, we are trying to make the whole process as democratic as possible by involving all organisations and associations in Sandalwood,” he said.Asked about the budget of the festival, he said the chief minister’s office had told them not to waste money on grandeur. “There are several pressing issues like floods in Kodagu, drought in other parts of the state and farmers’ distress. We will make every effort to keep the budget at the lowest,” he said.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Save your sandalwood trees for another year. Perhaps, then you can purchase a microchip from the Institute of Wood Science and Technology (IWST), link it to your smart phone, and save\\xa0your\\xa0tree from any where in the world.After two years of research and development on inserting microchips on sandalwood trees, IWST and Hitachi India Private Limited are now correcting the anomalies before making the service available\\xa0to public.Karnataka government had taken the lead in\\xa0inserting microchips on sandalwood trees. The move was to protect the Sandalwood -- the state tree of Karnataka -- from illegal loggers. The microchips would also help maintain a\\xa0sandalwood tree count. In October 2016, IWST and Hitachi had launched\\xa0an e-Protection System for High Value Trees, along with an App. Though the list included sandalwood, red sander and rose wood trees, the focus was on sandalwood. A\\xa0microchip is inserted\\xa0in the tree bark which detects threats if any,\\xa0 and sends an alert to the owner’s mobile phone.As a sample, IWST and Hitachi installed microchips on 100 sandalwood trees of which 50 are in a private land in Nelamanagala, and the remaining in the IWST campus in Bengaluru.“After we installed the chips, we got to know the technical issues. They are now being corrected, and then the chip will be available for people to purchase and install,” IWST Director Surendra Kumar told DH.Initially,\\xa0the hiccups were many. At times, the battery size was bigger than the tree-trunk.\\xa0 Also, the battery-life was just about 7 to 8 months and replacing it was a problem. The biggest\\xa0hurdle was the sensitivity of the chip to natural wear and tear. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday An Ola cab driver who was abducted, assaulted and robbed by four unidentified miscreants — who also forced his wife to strip on video call — is so traumatised by the incident that he has decided to return to his native in Andhra Pradesh.Shivakumar (name changed), 37, hails from Kadiri in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. He had come to the city 15 years ago and worked as a driver at call centres before moving to the cab aggregator five years ago.Speaking to\\xa0DH, Shivakumar said it was the second time that he was assaulted on duty. Previously, he was beaten up by a passenger during night shift.Shivakumar lives with his wife and two children at a rented house in Doddathogur.Friday nightmareShivakumar was abducted from Adugodi on Friday night by a gang that had hailed his cab.He initially thought he would be released unharmed after he gave in to their demands of withdrawing money from ATMs. But, even after giving them Rs 30,000, the assailants asked him to make a video-call to his wife, who was then forced to strip. The gang took screenshots of the act.Later, Shivakumar was taken to a lodge in Channapatna. When the robbers realised that he didn’t have any money left, they threatened to upload his wife’s screenshots on social media. He was forced to call his brother-in-law who, in turn, transferred him money online.In the lodge, Shivakumar said he overheard the assailants plotting to kill him on way to Madikeri. He, however, escaped through the window of the washroom.‘Run to station’After he escaped around 7.05 am on Saturday, Shivakumar came across a police constable attached to Channapatna station near the lodge and informed him about the incident. But the policeman asked him to “run” to the station and inform them. After spending nearly 30 minutes at the police station, two constables came to the lodge with him on two bikes, by which time the assailants had fled.Shivakumar said the assailants were looking for ganja and liquor on Friday night, but in vain. “They told me that I was alive because there was no ganja or liquor. They would have killed me in an inebriated state. They also said they are not afraid of police complaints,” he said.All the four assailants were aged between 22 and 30, well-built and spoke in Kannada and English.There has been no arrest in the case yet. The Adugodi police have formed a team to nab the culprits.Ola yet to reach out to victimShivakumar said that it has been three days since the assault and two days since he filed a police complaint but Ola, the company which facilitated the assailants to book the cab, had not contacted him. He said that like thousands of drivers, he worked day and night for the company but none from the Ola team contacted him to extend any support.To a query, an Ola spokesperson insisted that the company was \"on top of the case\".

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The Karnataka Tank Conservation and Development Authority (KTCDA) and the Minor Irrigation Department (MID) are again pressing for the collection of lake cess from residential and commercial complexes around lakes.According to them, the idea is not new. The officials assert that districts and cities have already implemented the idea, and the same should be done in Bengaluru also.The Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority (KLCDA) first came up with the proposal a year ago. However, the government and the cabinet did not accept it then.Manjunath, KTCDA Commissioner, said the lake cess was collected in other places and Bengaluru should also adopt this. Collecting the lake cess is essential as it would help the departments in their functioning, and would also bring a sense of responsibility among people.Both the departments are now examining the plan in detail and are working to pressing it before the government once again.They hope the proposal to be accepted as the government has shown a lot of trust in both the departments.Quoting the example of Bellandur and Varthur lakes, where locals point fingers at government officials for not doing anything and also give suggestions, the officials say that the citizens should also help the government in improving the lakes.V Govindaraj, Deputy Secretary, Water Resources, MID said: when KLCDA was repelled, the government order clearly stated that all works and proposals undertaken by the KLCDA would continue. The MID, the monitoring agency and the custodians of the lakes, should take onus and work towards it.The authority had mooted the idea when Madiwala Lake was being made a Biodiversity Park. The idea gained momentum when it found that a lot of garbage and sewage was entering the lake.KLCDA officials had also stated that as people enjoy the scenic view of lakes and builders sell properties as lake view, they should divert a part of their profits under the corporate social responsibility (CSR).They also noted that as the residents of areas around Puttenahalli Lake in JP Nagar contribute money for the lake conservation, the same can be extended to other places also.A senior urban development department official said the idea could be relooked.If lake cess is collected from the people, then they will have a sense of accountability, and this would also help in engaging them for conservation.

Today, the lake boasts clean water, a children’s park and an RO drinking water unit.\\xa0Biocon Foundation, the CSR arm of Biocon and\\xa0Syngene International Ltd, has\\xa0bio-rejuvenated the 35-acre lake in southern Bengaluru, leading to an improvement in the water quality and the return of flora and fauna. The project was launched following approvals from the Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority (KLCDA) and other government bodies.\\xa0Before that,\\xa0the lake was largely covered with invasive weeds. Garbage and sludge had accumulated in it over the years, leading to a foul smell.\\xa0The revival efforts began in\\xa02016 with a feasibility study of\\xa0remediation techniques for the lake’s revival.The next step was weeding the lake, composting the uprooted weeds and using the\\xa0resultant green cover for landscaping around the lake. Several bar screens were then installed at the inlets to prevent fresh garbage from entering the lake. Thereafter,\\xa0the 1.5-km lakebed was strengthened with native plants such as Vettiver\\xa0(camel grass) to prevent soil erosion. The last step was fencing the\\xa0lake.\\xa0What’s bioremediation?\\xa0Under\\xa0bioremediation, the lake was dosed with a blend of enzymes and microorganisms to rapidly digest organic pollutants.Multiple energy-efficient cascading aerators and submersible mixers were installed in the lake to enhance the level of dissolved oxygen in the water.Floating wetlands were deployed for the continuous natural cleaning process.\\xa0Getting labourers for the rejuvenation was a big challenge. As the lake is located in the middle of Hebbagodi, the narrow roads obstructed sand and material trucks. Workers encountered snakes in the lake.Sewage plant a mustThe lake, however, may get polluted again with the inflow of untreated sewage. Biocon Managing Director Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said a sewage treatment plant needed to be installed at the lake or else the whole revival effort would go waste.\\xa0“We are ready to set up the plant if the government permits it,” she said.“We chose Hebbagodi Lake to do our part to our community first.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Around 700 migrant families living in labour sheds at East Bengaluru have been forcefully evicted at the urging of the Mahadevapura MLA.The families, consisting of women, children and infants, were staying in\\xa0Devarabeesanahalli, Varthur, Kariyammana Agrahara, Munekolala and Bellandur.On the evening of November 30, a couple of earthmovers, with police presence, razed down a portion of the labour settlement at the Munekolala labour camp. Families occupying the shed rushed to take shelter at other\\xa0nearby sheds occupied by friends and relatives to spend the night. The labourers were given time till Monday to move out.The labour sheds came up on vacant private lands surrounding the lake about 10 years ago when East Bengaluru was witnessing a real-estate boom.Sources said local politicians decided to remove the labourers as they blamed them for the rise in incidents of crime. The police said they did not receive communication from the BBMP, though local land owners and the BBMP should seek police security for such evictions.“Even if the communication had come from BBMP, we wouldn’t have had time to gather a large force to offer security,” a senior police official said.About 700 families occupy these sheds, including infants, children and women, numbering around 7,000. The sheds are fanned out across the city’s eastern parts.A majority of these migrants are from West Bengal and Odisha, while a good number have also arrived here through the porous Bangladeshi borders in search of work.Sources said politicians regarded the settlement as a vote bank, while local leaders help them get Aadhaar cards and voter identification during election time.Post the election, local leaders studied the voting pattern among the settlers and found that the majority from West Bengal and Odisha voted for the Congress as the grand old party pledged its alliance with (West Bengal Chief Minister) Mamata Banerjee. Barely a few illegal Bangladeshis voted for the BJP out of loyalty.Clearly unhappy, political leaders threw the migrants out of their shelters with a deadline to leave by Monday, sources said.\\xa0Human rights activists and those working for economically weaker sections point out that the migrants have no other place to go. “There are infants and elderly people, too, among them,” said Khaleem Ullah, an activist with Movement for Justice. “They are evicted at a time when it is severely cold at night.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Members of ‘I Change Indiranagar’, a citizens’ forum, plan to conduct a tree census in the area much before the civic body could take up such activity across the city.The residents will take up the drive during weekends, beginning from December 2.With an aim to bring in an accountability for the number of trees the locality houses, the project involves mapping of trees in each street.“Most of the trees that we see today were planted decades ago when the layout was formed. However, there is no account of the number of trees existing, and that which have been axed or fallen down. The census will collaborate all such data,” said Sneha Nandihal, president, BM Kaval Resident’s Welfare Association.“It all began after we witnessed incidents where a tree fell on a motorist, injuring several people, and also building owners appealing to the civic body to axe trees for construction purposes or to put up hoardings, where the\\nPalike had indeed given permission to chop them,” recalls Sneha.The project would involve 10 volunteers, who will identify trees on every street, its location and assess the health. They will also record details such as the girth, height, locating the species and so on.After gathering data, if a tree requires immediate medical attention, the volunteers will help in fulfilling those needs.“We are taking the help of Gubbi Labs, a research organisation working towards sustainable ecosystems, for the project. Some students from a local college will also be involved,” said Kannan A S, another member of the forum.When asked why the residents are taking up the activity independently even though the civic body would soon take up the drive, Sneha said: “This is an independent activity we have been planning for a long time.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The horticulture department will plant four times the number of bamboo trees it removed in Cubbon Park, as the trees would improve the air quality and restore greenery in the Central Business District.The department is removing 200 bamboo stems and are replacing them with 400 trees in the first phase and has plans to plant 400 more saplings in phase 2. It hopes that the trees will be tall enough to give a greener look to the park by January.“Of over 300 species of bamboo, 12 that are suitable for Bengaluru will be planted at Cubbon Park. The entire plantation process would cost just Rs 1 lakh,” said Mahantesh Murgod, deputy director, horticulture department (Cubbon Park).Among the tree species chosen are those growing in the Western Ghats, Kerala and Assam.They include Bambusa bamboo, Indocalamus bamboo, Tulda bamboo, Dendrocala bamboo, Ochlandra bamboo and Myanmar (Burma) bamboo.Though the department had plans to plant other native trees, it finally settled on bamboo since city residents have fond memories of the tree. Besides, bamboo also grows faster and looks pleasing to the eyes.The department has also planned to create a system to grow bamboo and also educate people on several varieties of bamboo trees.Extensive survey\\xa0Officials from the department and experts scoured several nurseries and institutes across the nation for the right kind of species that would suit Bengaluru’s conditions.While the saplings planted in the park are one to three metres tall, they would rapidly grow to 12 feet in a month’s time.Noted environmentalist and member of the horticulture department’s expert committee A N Yellappa Reddy said bamboo has been chosen over other kind of trees since it grows faster and uses little water.Bamboos have monocot roots, which, unlike the tap roots in the other trees, grow only up to a metre deep inside the earth and are ideal to be grown in the city centre.Reddy said the area needs bamboo since water evaporation from its trees are less compared to other tree varieties, while they also release a large amount of oxygen, which is much needed in the CBD area.Murgod said tree data will be collected in Cubbon Park after the exercise to digitise flora in the Lalbagh Botanical Garden ends.All trees, including the bamboo clusters, will be digitised. A tree census has already been completed in Cubbon Park and digitisation will be the next step. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

Krishnamurthy has claimed that political influence was behind the appointment these members as they had produced the recommendation letters issued by legislator H M Revanna and others. According to him, even though he was an aspirant with a clean image, without considering it and without affording an opportunity of hearing, the members of the committee were appointed on March 8.The court adjourned the hearing.

If a person develops resistance to one antibiotics, none of the other antibiotics would work. It’s a dangerous situation for patients,” Dr Ravi said.He said patients also become resistant to antibiotics as they consume meat or fish injected with the medicine. “Chicken, meat and eggs injected with antibiotics easily transmit the medicine to human and in some cases result in AMR,” he said.Dr R Ravi Kumar, who heads NIMHANS’ department of Neuromicrobiology, said antibiotics administered for gastro, urinary tract and respiratory infections are gradually developing resistance. “Patients don’t complete the course also cases AMR,” he added.WalkathonThe Microcon conference, the first ever, was launched on Thursday with a walkathon with a slogan \"Stop antimicrobial resistance\".

One country may benefit from it (protectionism). But we should not accept such artificial barriers, which hurt many, he said.“Constitution has kept us together.

We will rear butterflies in the laboratory and release into the park where their food source of around 400 plant species will be grown,” he added.The horticulture department had consulted the Kerala Forest Research Institute, which has constructed a similar garden in Nilambur. Two acres will be an open air butterfly park that will have shrubs, herbs, climbers and other trees.The project\\xa0also includes a taxonomy garden and a fragrance garden -- a space with fruit-bearing trees and plant species that are endangered and are endemic to the Western Ghats that will lure birds that depend on\\xa0specific plant species.“In two acres we will plant rare saplings from the western ghats, we have already started to collect the saplings,” explained M Jagadeesh.“Horticulture department will collect 125 endangered species and plant them in one acre. Around 175 different kinds of fruit-bearing tree species will be planted which will be a perennial habitat for birds in Lalbagh,” he added.The total cost of the project is estimated at around Rs 75 lakh.

It also helps in bringing people together through their love for dance and thus Taandav was born.”Vishal, a photographer, says that he was inspired by his brother.The Soman brothers found through the dance sessions that it also helped in boosting the confidence of the persons with disabilities to a large extent and also helped in improving their coordination skills.The ‘Attam Inclusive dance troupe’ which meets for practice in Cubbon Park comprises of volunteers with various disabilities who learn and practice various dance forms like Bhangra, Bollywood and Dappan Koothu, a folk dance from Tamil Nadu.The volunteer dance facilitators of Smileys India also conduct regular dance classes for the visually impaired and the deaf children at various non government organisations in the city.Vishnu said, “Taandav is the only dance festival in the country where people who cannot see, hear or speak learn and perform various dance forms,”The Taandav festival which is set to take place on December 16 aims at celebrating the spirit of dance with people from all walks of life.The participants include children from children homes, persons with hearing disabilities, visual impairment, limited mobility and those with cerebral palsy and autism who will dance alongside their facilitators and volunteers.

In their reply, walkers listed their problems and sought immediate action.Of the 120-plus walkers and joggers interviewed, 94 complained about the garbage, especially whenever mega-events like flower show or training programmes are held. “Even on normal days, heaps of garbage including leftover eatables, carry bags and juice bottles are seen all over the park. Sometimes, dustbins are overflowing but the staff don’t clear them,” revealed Manjunath, a walker and a resident of N R Colony.Several senior citizens and women are worried about the lack of emergency medical facilities. In all, 61 people complained about the absence of emergency healthcare at the park.“At least during morning and evening hours, one ambulance must be stationed at each gate. Maybe an emergency centre with CPR facility will help,” opined Janardhan, a walker from Sudhamanagar. \\xa0About 60% of the people complained about lack of potable water points.“The department has banned water bottles in the park. Many of the existing water points go dry in the morning and are unhygienic. Officials must set up water dispensing points wherever walkers sit or stop briefly,” Imran Pasha, a walker from Siddapur said.Walkers also complained about the lack of toilets, especially for women. “The existing toilets are in a remote corner. Sometimes, children and men urinate in the open. More security personnel need to be deployed to curb this problem,” Sudha, a walker from Wilson Garden said.Many joggers and walkers complained about pushcarts selling eatables spoiling the landscape.“The geological monument, where the Kempegowda tower is located, is littered with eatables and food wrappers. Vendors have illegally parked their carts on top of the hillock. Why haven’t the officials cleared them? Also, four and two-wheelers roam all over the park.

Exposure to passive smoking is no exception.People exposed to all kinds of emission --including vehicle exhaust and fumes emitted from industries --are at risk, said Dr Niti Raizada, Consultant Medical Oncologist and Hemato-oncologist, Vikram Hospital.She said, exposure to carcinogenic toxins like asbestos and radon; also radiation and air pollutants are other causes for lung cancer. Women's exposure to charcoal smoke (while cooking) was also a cause for lung cancer.“Only 15% of cases of lung cancer are curable at the time of diagnosis. Patients with lung cancer present themselves at a much later stage than other cancers, due to the nature of the disease. If lung cancer is detected by chest X-ray, it is already too late for the patient. The only effective method for screening lung cancer in early stages is the Low Dose Helical Lung CT, where high-resolution images pick up early lung lesions,” she added.Dr Suraj Manjunath, consultant Onco-surgeon at the hospital said “Lung cancer has one of the highest morbidity and mortality among all cancers. It accounts for 14.5% of all cancers in men and 8.4% in women globally. It is a leading cause of cancer death in men worldwide at 22%, which means that one in five of all cancer deaths in men occur due to lung cancer.

       "  \"Get the best of news in your inbox everyday November 19 was a nightmare for Bengaluru's commuters. Other than the fact that it was Monday morning, a farmers' protest march near Freedom Park created a dominoes' effect, sending the entire city traffic into a tizzy. The jams brought out the worst in several commuters (the stress might have evoked a fight or flight situation) which at some places worsened the jams.\\xa0DH lists out six types of road-users who consciously or unconsciously (unfortunately) add to the city’s traffic snarls:1.\\xa0Those who shift lanes with such flexibility that even a gymnast would be envious of them. Who said that they cannot take the right turn while being on the extreme left of the road? Does it create a traffic snarl? If so, too bad for others. Because nobody can stop them from taking that turn. Reminds me of a chicken crossing the road.\\xa02. Dear chatters who park vehicles on the side of an already jammed road, because a phone call is more important than others reaching their destinations. We wonder if this has happened to them as well when they need to get to a destination, but someone is busy chatting on their phone ahead of them. Wake-up call!\\xa03.\\xa0Even worse are the road-users who talk on their phones while driving/riding/crossing roads. As they animatedly speak on their phones, they forget that there are other commuters. Maybe we could give them a call to let them know!\\xa04. Direction blinkers are for dummies! 'We don't reveal our plans beforehand' said the driver who took a right turn out of the blue, sending the vehicles behind him to hit their brakes for dear life.\\xa0\\xa05. The two-wheelers who will just squeeze into a small space, because they can. Scratches on your vehicle, lane-shifting, troubled pedestrians, irate fellow commuters\\xa0honking at them: nothing deters them. Life is a race, remember? And they are just trying to get ahead of you.\\xa06. Empty autos who trail on the side of the roads because, customers! Whom they will refuse, anyway. But meanwhile, no traffic snarls will keep them from riding the way they want to.\\xa0Cherry on top: people who park on busy streets with limited parking with such dexterity that even pedestrians find it hard to navigate their way onto the pavement. There might be several more subjects of traffic nightmares.

Speaking to DH, Randeep D, additional commissioner, (Admin), BBMP, said the measure was aimed at eliminating allegations of irregularities while dropping the dogs back.“There have been complaints that the dogs are not let back in their specific area after surgery, which leads to many problems. This is a measure to bring in more transparency in keeping track of the vehicles,” said Randeep.The BBMP has come under severe criticism from pet lovers, councillors and even Deputy Chief Minister and Bangalore Development Minister G Parameshwara on the rising cases of stray dog menace and botched surgeries under the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme.The civic body is now planning to track the trucks through GPS, along with the project to install microchip collar for dogs, which helps in identifying each dog. The chip will be linked to the software.“We can even go a step further and update information about every dog that has been treated, its area and so on on the BBMP website,” Randeep said.The installation of microchip as collars was first thought about by former mayor R Sampath Raj during his tenure. “We are still working on the cost and other processes,” said Randeep.BlacklistedThe BBMP also blacklisted two organisations for violating norms in birth control treatment. They are Sarvodaya Sevabhavi Samsthe and Animal Rights Fund (ARF).While Sarvodaya Sevabhavi Samsthe was accused of treating dogs with expired drugs, the ARF was charged with several cases of botched surgeries. “The ARF was involved in cost-cutting process. So it was noted that the quality has deteriorated during surgeries,” said Dr G Anand, joint director, animal husbandry, BBMP.He also said the payments to the two organisations have been frozen and that the issue has been handed over to the Animal Welfare Department.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Noise pollution is turning out to be a threat as big as air pollution itself, if statistics are anything to go by.According to a recent analysis by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), noise pollution is more in residential areas and notified silent zones when compared to industrial areas.KSPCB member secretary Manoj Kumar said it was a matter of worry. He said decibel levels were high in residential areas because of the increasing commercial activities there and the mixed categories of zones.The regulations are more stringent in industrial areas, where there is more discipline in the movement of vehicles, parking and industry operations, which has ensured a check in noise pollution.But that is not the case in residential and commercial areas.In fact, the silent zones — around educational institutions, hospitals, courts and religious places — have become more noisy, said another senior KSPCB official.According to the Pollution Control Board data, noise pollution was 57.5% more in the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health (Nimhans), which is a sensitive area, in the month of September.It was 19.3% high in Teri Office, Domlur, a residential area; 52% more in BTM layout, 17.1% more in SG Halli; 10.3% more on Church Street; 15% at Yeshwanthpur police station and within limits at Whitefield and Peenya Industrial area. These levels were recorded at night when traffic tends to be less.As per standards, noise pollution levels in residential areas should be 55 decibels, 65 in commercial areas, 50 in sensitive areas and 75 in industrial areas.Air pollution also highResidential areas presented a bleak picture on air pollution front, too. Manoj Kumar said while the situation was getting better in industrial areas, air pollution was increasing in residential and commercial areas.This is another indication of the impact that the increasing mixed zones have on the environment, calling for serious action by the government.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Efforts by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike to beautify the black spots by drawing rangolis did not yield positive results as citizens continued to dump garbage.\\xa0\\xa0On the occasion of Kannada Rajyotsava, the civic body joined hands with The Ugly Indian and other volunteers to hold a rangoli festival with an aim to clear at least five black spots in each ward. It covered around 800 black spots.However, citizens were seen dumping garbage right where the pourakarmikas had drawn rangolis to stop people from littering.Pourakarmikas cleared garbage from the black spots identified with the help of junior health inspectors. Once the garbage was removed, the pourakarmikas and residents began drawing rangolis. BBMP officials took part in the festival along with members of ward committees and residents’ welfare associations.Speaking to DH, BBMP Additional Commissioner (Health) D Randeep said: “This initiative received good response from the public. We made sure the garbage dumped on the black spots is cleared within 48 hours.”“But some continued to dump garbage and littered the road. We engaged the marshals and penalised the offenders,” he added.The Ugly Indian group had trained the civic body officials and pourakarmikas to beautify the black spots.A volunteer from The Ugly Indian said: “Rangoli is a great way to prevent garbage dumping and wipe out the black spots. This (initiative) is creating awareness among people with support from the BBMP and their staff.”The volunteer said if people become aware that they should not litter the streets, it would be possible to reduce the garbage black spots to a great extent.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) suspects that the death of Common Coot, a variety of aquatic birds in Kasavanahalli Lake, is due to avian flu.According to P Jagannath Rao, the deputy conservator of forest, no deaths of birds were reported since Saturday.“Had the deaths continued, we would conduct the autopsy of the carcass to find the exact reason for the deaths,” he said.“I think the deaths happened due to some sort of avian flu. The fish in the lake are thriving. So we do not suspect a high volume of toxic pollutants entering the waterbody, or some deliberate attempt to poison the birds,” Rao added.On Friday, more than seven coots were found dead on the shore of Kasavanahalli Lake in Bellandur. There were several doubts over the cause of deaths. While a few locals claimed that the birds died because of the involvement of a fish contractor, who might have poisoned the birds, local lake protection group members claimed it could be due to avian flu or the cyanobacteria bloom in the lake.The residents of Kasavanahalli checked all the inlets and outlets of the lake and found that no sewage was let into the lake. The fishermen also said the water in the lake is good and that no fishes have died.Some non-government organisations and water scientists have sent the water samples of the lake to a lab for testing, the results of which will come on Tuesday.Asha Suresh, local corporator, said her team would conduct an inspection on Monday to check if there is any sewage leakage into the lake from the stormwater drain that runs parallel to the lake.\\n“If the sewage is entering the lake, we will take immediate action,” she said.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

A small accident on the way to work inspired him to take action with the help of his friends.Hebbi told DH, “A few months back, I had a minor accident wherein the bumper of my car came off owing to the big jerk caused by a pothole. I ended up spending Rs 4,000 to get it repaired. The money that I spent for repairs could have been used to repair a pothole to help others and thus I started doing that.”Hebbi, along with his friends, meets once a week to fill potholes. During the course of the week, they identify potholes to be filled. Following this, they spend two hours over a weekend and fill them using the materials they are able to source.“It only takes a few dedicated minutes to fix a pothole. One can fill a pothole using gravel, sand and cement,” he adds.\\xa0In another initiative, Prashanth Maruru, an employee at an engineering college started a pothole challenge after fixing a pothole near his house. He shared his story on social media and tagged his friends to follow suit.“I drive a two-wheeler and have faced the perils of potholes in the city. Potholes are one of the major reasons for accidents in the city,” says Maruru.Maruru adds, “It does not take much to fill a pothole. Using simple available material like gravel, sand an cement, one can fill a pothole. It did not cost me much to fill a pothole. Imagine if everyone takes up this task, the city’s roads will soon be pothole-free.”It is not just residents, but even companies have included pothole filling as part of their CSR initiatives wherein they have joined hands with ‘Pothole Raja’ (Prathap Bhimasena Rao) to fill potholes near their premises.

This program will bring hundreds of people which will cause a huge nuisance in the area. How did the police permit this?” asked a resident.White Orchid and the Manpho Convention Hall in Manyata Tech park host events through the week. To manage traffic movement in and around Manyata tech park, the employees of the IT firms have been issued traffic advisories drafted by Manyata management.“The last Sunday morning, commuters were stuck in traffic for two hours because of programs at White Orchid and Manpho Convention hall,” said another resident. An Abacus examination and an intercollegiate function where a Telugu actor was invited threw traffic out of gear recently, he added.The North division traffic police said that they have been instructed to supervise and monitor traffic movement and keep it moving all the time. “The traffic police would enforce smooth traffic flow. Even if it is slow-moving, our job is to keep\\xa0it flowing as the developmental work continues,” said Sarah Fatima, DCP North Division (Traffic).Moreover, the traffic police cannot interfere with permissions for an event. It is the law and order police who\\xa0gives\\xa0permission to organisers and provides security\\xa0for an\\xa0event. The permission had been granted a month back after taking into consideration factors like the weekend when IT employees have an off. Moreover, only over a 1000 tickets have been issued for the closed event, said a senior police officer.However, sources from the residential locality said that despite their requests that programs like these do not get conducted until the white topping work is completed, a minister pressurised the police to grant permission.

The who’s who of the literary fraternity and crowds had gathered to engage in intelligent and thought-provoking discussions, but basic etiquette seemed to be missing from the festival.The majority of visitors seemed to ignore the dustbins available every few feet and chose to leave used paper plates and cups on tables or on sides of walkways.“It is an irony,\" said Sonal Kumari, an artist and a ‘budding environmentalist’ (as she calls herself). \"This is supposed to be a hub of well-read, educated people who visit here to enhance their knowledge or contribute to the conversations. Yet, they seemed to have forgotten the very basics of cultured behaviour.” She pointed out how the lesson ‘throw waste in a bin’ is taught to toddlers, but grownups are the ones who often ignore it.“I guess walking a few steps in heels and fancy shoes was a bit too much work for the people here,\" said Kavya, a student. \"I wonder if they were expecting volunteers to walk around with garbage bags to collect the trash like they do in aeroplanes.”At the end of the day, the organisers did create a wonderful platform for engaging dialogues and conversations on burning issues.

The video was widely liked and shared on social media after it was uploaded on Oct. 16.The video - \\'Bharatnatya Saaku, #FootPathBeku\\' - created by members of an informal citizens\\' group, Malleshwaram Social, is sarcastic, funny and nicely drives home the message. It begins with two women on a road missing a footpath that\\'s covered with construction debris. Dejected, they decide to wear their ghungroos, summon musicians and begin a \\'dance\\' to discover a path to tread.\\n\"We try to highlight such issues that affect the residents directly or directly,\" said Dhanush N, a 27-year-old techie and member of Malleshwaram Social. \"Malleswaram is a locality with the majority of senior citizens who need proper infrastructure, especially the footpaths.

When kids are being bowled over by mobile and tablet screens, we are attempting to introduce them to the joy of reading,” Raghuram said.According to the organisers about two lakh\\xa0people will visit the festival. The week-long fest is likely to bring about Rs 10-crore business to the publishers. “There will be a publisher from every corner of the country.

Besides, there will be learning and vocabulary enhancing games and material for kids.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday A quiet corner in the ground floor of Anupama Hoskere’s house in Banashankari 2nd Stage has turned into a shrine of tradition. As part of Dasara festivities, she has\\xa0decorated it with over 10,000 dolls.This year she has themed her arrangement as ‘Srinivasa Kalyana’ - depicting that hardships, kindness, responsibility, and compassion are all an integral part of life.Her dolls ranging from 3 inches to 30 feet include various Dasara dolls, goddess Gauri idols, dolls depicting scenes\\xa0from Mahabharata, Ramayana and the Bhagavad Gita.The specialty of this year’s arrangement is the presence of western dolls and South Indian Miniature Brass (utensils and dolls made out of brass).“Every doll in my arrangement is a depiction of a story and a tradition. Many people including children are not aware of the history of the time when brass was predominantly used. I have kept over 30 types of miniature utensils that will attract children,” said Hoskere, Director, Dhaatu Puppet Theater.\\xa0Some of the dolls are made by Anupama herself. “I have made more than 600 wooden dolls which are also a part of the present doll arrangement,” she said.Symbol of beauty“Not many are interested\\xa0in arranging dolls for Dasara. Some do not have enough space in their homes or the time to arrange the dolls. But many\\xa0are interested at least to witness them as every doll is a symbol of beauty and tradition speaking to the viewer through a story,” said Anupama.The exhibition of dolls will be on till November 3\\xa0with several puppet shows and performances.She added, “The doll manufacturing culture in the state is depleting. If that is considered prime, then it will give rise to a lot of artists and jobs.” Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday For the first time in the history of the institute, psychiatrists at National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) have planned a guided tour for the public to remove the stigma attached to mental illness.With many people\\xa0asking questions, like ‘Do all patients, who go for mental illness treatment, get a shock treatment?’, the psychiatrists have decided to\\xa0throw open the Institute’s doors for visitors\\xa0for a day.\\xa0Department of Mental Health Education,\\xa0NIMHANS, will be\\xa0organising ‘Stories against Stigma’ on October 27 where visitors can register for Rs 100 and take a tour\\xa0of the institute. Based on the response the pilot project receives, more such tours will be conducted once in two months.“It will be open to the public to propagate de-stigmatsation of ‘lunatic asylums’. Furthermore, by this association, we aim to make people feel more comfortable in seeking help for mental health problems as we introduce different perspectives of looking at the stigma attached to mental health,” said Dr K S Meena, Associate Professor, Department of Mental Health Education.Though the public will not be allowed access inside the wards which house patients for treatment, a glimpse of it can be taken. The heritage building and psychiatric wards would be shown to patients.“There is a wrong perception of shock treatment as part of mental health treatment. We call it Electroconvulsive therapy in medical terms. It does not happen as depicted in movies. Neither are the patients as violent as people believe them to be,” said Dr Meena.YogaNIMHANS has developed modules integrating yoga with mental health and research. Besides, for those with mental retardation, bakery classes, computer training is also conducted. The tour will also give access to these areas. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

They will also keep a watch out for misbehaviour.\\xa0“While most of the morning walkers coming to Labagh are genuine, there are many miscreants also. We observed for a month and assessed the crowd before deploying women. Initially, we were very reluctant to deploy women staffers. We were worried about the gender disparity and their safety. But we found that it worked,” a senior Horticulture Department told DH.The official said the women stand at Lalbagh main gate and the west gate from 6 am to 7 am.\\xa0For added safety, male guards and CCTV cameras are also deployed.“We found that many bring biscuits, millets, grains and other food items in plastic carry bags. They feed animals and birds and litter the place. We also found that some people enter the Garden as morning walkers\\xa0and enjoy free tours and even indulge in illegal activities. When male guards\\xa0would question, they would be abused and even physically assaulted. But with females, people have started to behave and some have even stopped coming inside,” the official added.This has created a mixed response among walkers. While some are happy with the idea, some say that this is just a method to harass people.“What is the need to deploy additional security, that too woman. We have been coming for years together. Does the department not trust us? This will only create more chaos,” said Shivangi, a morning walker.However P Sadashiva Reddy, President of Lalbagh Morning Walkers Association, said that this was a welcome move. “In fact, we will help them (women guards). This has helped control the menace to some extent,” he said. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

After my swab results came out, I realised how I got the infection,\" the doctor said.\"It is a first-hand experience for me to go through the symptoms of the infection I am treating. The infection besides having the severe form of fever and cold also had myalgia. It has been a week, and even now I have mild myalgia and cough. The symptoms are sometimes unbearable,” the doctor added.Two other doctors from government hospitals have also been tested positive for H1N1 flu. Among the two, one of the doctors had co-morbid conditions and was hospitalised for a few days.Dr C Nagaraja, Director of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD), said though H1N1 flu is a contagious infection, it can still be prevented.\"One of the ways of contracting infection is if a person inhales the droplets of an infected person. One will not contract the infection by walking into an H1N1 flu ward, however certain basic preventive measures like washing hands and maintaining hygiene can help curb the spread of the infection,\" he added.

Our police force works amidst a garbage of vehicles dumped since decades. The reasons could be many, accident, theft, unattended, litigation etc., but the result is the same. Vehicles become scrap and negative work environment.”Another user, venugopal\\u200f (@ksvenu247) said, “There are many piled up on footpaths near police stations.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The students of Bangalore North University (BNU) and its affiliated colleges have raised their displeasure with the university’s demand to upload their details to web portals. As most of the affiliated colleges are situated in rural areas they\\xa0are plagued\\xa0with poor internet connectivity and shortage of computers in the colleges. “This should be done by the colleges and the university. Instead, they are putting the burden on us. They are aware that rural students lack such facilities,\\xa0yet they are insisting that we\\xa0do it for ourself. The internet connectivity is very poor\\xa0and it takes at least half an hour to upload the details,” said a student of a college affiliated to BNU.The students are a worried lot as the last date to upload the details is on October 10. They\\xa0are forced\\xa0to visit cyber cafes in the nearby towns, not only missing their classes but also paying a hefty sum.“The owners demand Rs 150 – 200 to upload each student’s details. It has become a huge burden for students from economically weak sections. Even colleges\\xa0have a scarcity\\xa0of computer systems and internet,” the student added.Dr T D Kemparaju, vice-chancellor, BNU told DH, “This move was intended to have all the stakeholders collectively participate. There were instances, where the student would notice an error in the marks card after receiving it. Then he/she\\xa0would have to run pillar to post to get it corrected.\\xa0With the new process, the student can enter his/her accurate details and also get the acknowledgement for the same. It is easier to spot where things go wrong.”In the latest process, the students’ details will go through three levels. The first level is with the students, the second with the college and the third at the university. When asked about the time constraints, the VC said, “We are more likely to extend the deadline. Since this is for the benefit of the students we will take a decision accordingly.” Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

Most of our neighbours are suffering from breathing related diseases as it is impossible to get fresh air in the air. Tenants are also vacating their houses as the situation\\xa0gets worse when it rains,” said Eerappa, a resident of Hosakerehalli village.In 2015,\\xa0Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had taken up the rejuvenation of\\xa0the lake and begun cleaning operations.\\xa0The lake regained its beauty and soon resembled a bird sanctuary\\xa0with many migratory birds flocking to it. But the civic body’s negligence has made all the hard work go in vain.A resident on condition of anonymity said the lake has turned into a dumpyard within six months. “We are scared that the lake will overflow after heavy rains and enter the residential areas. The civic body has failed to check the encroachment of the lake bed,” he said.Shivappa, a villager, said, “We have lodged several complaints with civic bodies. Officials are just negligent towards this. We have been keeping an eye out on the lake, but people dump waste\\xa0at\\xa0night. As common people how much more can we do?”For the rejuvenation of the lake, spread over 59 acres, Rs 9.40 crore was sanctioned. BDA officials said 40% of the rejuvenation project has been completed and they have approximately spent Rs 1.80 crore till date.“One acre twenty guntas of the lake area has been encroached by the residents. After the tahasildar finishes the marking process, we are going to fence the lake area. Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) is taking up the pipe laying project to divert the sewage water. Once it’s done, the water body will be fit to store rain water,” Sumathi, Assistant Executive Engineer told DH.When asked about the deadline for the completion of the project, the official said, “We are going to complete it by March 2019.

This he hoped would help the centre survive, and make the Gandhian philosophy alive among the present generation.“The decision was taken in the syndicate meeting. The aim of establishing the new centres is to make the current generation aware of the values and the preachings of the great personalities,” BU VC told DH.“For now Jindal group has agreed to provide the necessary financial support for the projects. We need books and study materials, and we will have to approach other companies also. The university will provide the necessary land for the centres,” the vice-chancellor said.“Maha Bodhi Society in Bengaluru had demanded the study centre on Buddha. As the Dalai Lama Institute for Higher Education is already affiliated to our varsity, we can expect the students to be part of the Gautama Buddha study centre. We will also make this as a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), where this will reach many students,” the vice-chancellor added.The syndicate also plans to make one MOOC course on any of the four personalities compulsory for the student to clear the degree course.“The decision regarding this should be reviewed in the next syndicate meeting. Along with revamping of Gandhian\\nstudies, we intend to set up the centres by the December, where students can join by the next academic year,” the VC added.\\xa0 Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday The state government is all set to declare three districts open defecation-free in the state. Work is on to ensure that sufficient toilets are built in four more districts to qualify them for the tag. Principal Secretary of the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) L K Ateeq announced this at a workshop in the city on Friday.RDPR Commissioner Dr Vishal R said works in Chitradurga, Kalaburagi and Tumakuru districts have been completed.“The declaration will come after verification, which is under progress,” he said. As many as 80,000 toilets are yet to be built in four districts of Bidar, Vijayapura, Belagavi and Raichur. On Wednesday, Yadgir district was declared open-defecation free. To bag the “Open Defecation-free,” tag, no fecal matter should be visible and it should be treated effectively, said Dr Vishal.As per the estimate of 2011 socio-economic survey, five lakh more beneficiaries have been added.“We have written to the central government seeking funds for this. They will give us Rs 7,200 per toilet and the state will invest a certain sum for the construction work. It is implemented in 60:40 ration where the Centre bears the larger expense,” he said.RDPR Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said even enough toilets were being constructed, there was a need to bring behavioural changes among people.“We must ensure that the main intention of the Swachch Bharat Abhiyan or any other campaigns directed towards the purpose is not forgotten,” he said. He sought to know why the government was still being held responsible when toilets were built and the people did not use them.“There is a need to inculcate a change in the mindset of the people. Within a month, we will reach the target of toilet constructions.There is a need to reach out to rural masses through internet. It is only inappropriate to think that they are not technologically advanced. With most of country having an access to the internet, messages on hygiene can be spread through social media,” he said.Complaints across the state are common that though toilets are built, they have been rendered unusable due to lack of water supply and poor maintenance, Krishna Byre Gowda added.

On examination, we found that he was injured by the stapler pins on a wristband, which the school had provided him. He was looking for me to help him remove the band. No one had attended to him,\" she said.Students\\xa0participating in the Independence\\xa0Day celebrations were asked to gather in their classrooms prior to the performance on August 15. The mother, who has sought anonymity, said that she was not allowed to meet her child despite requests.\"Why should children be held back in the classroom for so long, especially when it is a holiday and the other students are performing?\" she questioned. She said that none of the teachers had taken note of the injury until she pointed it out.Speaking about the incident, Susheela S, Director, Vishwa Vidyapeeth International School, said, the school had apologised to the parent for the staple pin injury.\"It is tough for us to manage so many children at once. It is to facilitate convenience that these children were made into batches and asked to sit in their classrooms while the other students were performing,\" she said.She claimed that the parent of the child had threatened to take necessary action if the school did not respond to her.\\xa0She also sought to know why the parent had lodged a complaint several months after the incident. \"The child has also been taken out of school. We are only hopeful that incidents like these do not affect the child\\'s education,\" said Susheela.PhotographsYet another aspect mentioned in the complaint lodged with Makkala Sahayavani on October 1 is that the mother\\'s photographs were taken without consent. The complainant has said that during a meeting with the school in subsequent weeks, her photographs were clicked.\"I asked them to show me the pictures but I was told that the photographer had left the venue. It was after this incident that I lost confidence and stopped sending my son to the school,\" she said.\\xa0The school authorities said that during the \\'Mother on duty\\' event, photographs of participants who speak in the discussion are taken and the best speaker is awarded on Women\\'s day. \"Only group pictures were taken during the event.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday Days after being rapped by the high court over the poor maintenance of roads, the BBMP has chosen to dig a borewell right in the middle of a road, ostensibly to provide water to “the residents” in the area.Thursday morning brought a shocker to residents of Vinayak Nagar of Ward 113 in HAL limits when a borewell truck began drilling in the middle of the road.Anxious residents who took the pain to know the reason for this destruction were told to ‘shut up’ by the local corporator.“We were wondering as to who would permit to dig a borewell on a newly laid road. Some residents reached out to the corporator expressing their concern only to be told that it was in the interest of the residents in the area,” a resident on condition of anonymity told DH.Another resident said if the BBMP was taking up a project for the benefit of the public, at least some of the residents should have been consulted.“There is no issue with water supply in the area, and we never asked for a public borewell. If the BBMP wanted to serve us, they should have at least asked us about it,” the resident said.The residents demanded to know whether it was in line with the rules to sanction drilling of a borewell in the middle of the road.“The very idea of such a project is absurd. It not only obstructs traffic but causes inconvenience to all road users,” he rued.‘BJP workers oppose’However, the project took an interesting political turn when DH spoke to corporator M Chandrappa Reddy.He said those opposing the borewell were not the residents, but supporters of the BJP.“It was close to one and a half months since the locality got water and we drilled the borewell to supply water to the residents. We have taken permission from BBMP officials,” said Reddy. “We are testing if we could get water here. Once the borewell work is done, we will cover the place with cement,” he added.Meanwhile, Prasanna, assistant executive engineer, also said that the permission was granted to dig the borewell.“This place was chosen because if we go too near to the house, the foundation would be affected,” he said.“We have dug up to six to eight inches. It will not harm the road as we will restore it. We have also taken the help of geologists to find the best spot to locate water,” Prasanna added. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

Later they were referred to the hospital's Bannerghatta branch. On their way, the family even enquired at Nimhans, which did not have a vacant bed with ventilator. Finally, when Balraj was brought to the Fortis Hospital on Bannerghatta Road, the doctors there declared him brain-dead.Balraj's son Prem Kumar said they could have taken him to the nearest hospital having all the facilities, but were made to run around the city.“My father had hypertension and diabetes. He had collapsed after vomiting. Every minute was precious. However, by the time he got treatment, he was declared brain-dead.

They are demanding that governance and development should be the first priority,” Shetty said.Shetty said 800 other Ram Mandirs and several ponds “where Rama is said to have dipped his hands or feet” are in decrepit condition. “I thought people should see through this. If my exhibition encourages them to visit Ayodhya and witness the reality, I will think of it as a success,” he said.The exhibition was one of the major draws among other events, live drawing and painting, public art installation and recital of Gandhi's favourite songs, organised at the Boulevard on Tuesday.

Will the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) be able to manage solid waste with this growing capacity? That remains the biggest concern for the residents of the city.“According to statistics projected by the draft of Revised Master Plan-2031 prepared by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), the population of the city is expected to reach 20 million,” said BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad.At present, the city generates close to 5,700 metric tonnes of waste, out of which close to 4,200 metric tonnes is wet waste and about 1,200 is dry waste.With the growing population and according to projections by the BDA, the amount of garbage is expected to be more than double of today’s capacities.Close to 13,911 metric tonnes of garbage will be generated by 2031, as nearby villages will also be included in city limits.Plans galore, but...Though the BBMP has an excellent plan to collect and process waste, it has failed to implement it, said solid waste management expert Sandhya Narayan, who is also a member of the Solid Waste Management Round Table.“The BBMP has several plans, including the microplan, dry waste collection, and waste processing plants that process garbage at ward levels. But none of them is being implemented. It has to be looked into why they are not able to implement them,” she said.Manjunath Prasad said, “We have studied that the city will have a population of close to 20 million. The projections are done by considering both the core and outer areas. We are trying to strengthen the process of collection and transportation of garbage in the city. We are setting up transfer stations across the city which will bring in mechanised process in the entire exercise. We are also looking at establishing dry waste collection centres in all wards.”The transfer station will also compress the waste once collected and reduce the capacity to half, as most of the wet waste consists of moisture, he said.He also cited several reasons why the civic body is failing to enforce solid waste management rules. “There is a lot of resistance some time as the contractor lobby is very strong. For instance, they want to run the dry waste collection centres and take over the autos that go for dry waste collection. We are trying our best to root out this, and the abolition of contract system for pourakarmikas is one such example,” he said. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday At a seminar organised by Bangalore Institute of Legal Studies (BILS) on Saturday,\\xa0participants presented\\xa0a holistic approach to the issue of migration, an issue which has\\ninternationally gained relevance. Having the theme ‘Migration and Regional Development in India’, the seminar saw participation from nearly 60\\xa0members from across the country.“The seminar aims to discuss the implications of domestic and international migrations on India involving all dimensions- social, cultural, economic and political. The process of migration has both positive and negative consequences,” Kamalakshy K, faculty-in-charge and assistant professor BILS told DH.The paper presentations included subjects like ‘International migrations and its impact on economic and social development in India’, ‘Inter-state migration and regional disparities’,\\n‘Migration and urban transition in India’, ‘Impact of migration on the Fiscal policy of India’ and ‘Judicial response on illegal migration and deportation’.“This is the second national seminar organised by BILS. Focussing on the relevant\\xa0topics of the day it aims to give a holistic approach to the problem. Since the paper presenters come from different parts of\\xa0the country it helps in analysing the situation better,” she added. Ⓒ 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.

       "  'Get the best of news in your inbox everyday A city civil and sessions court adjourned actor Duniya Vijay’s bail plea to Monday, forcing him to spend his weekend at the Parappana Agrahara Central Prison.Vijay’s counsel told the court that serious IPC sections were pressed against his client to prevent him from getting bail. The actor visited the police station with celebrity gym trainer Maruthi Gowda after the latter’s uncle H Krishnamurthy alias Kitty lodged a complaint of abduction and assault against him.The counsel also reminded the court that a case has been registered against Kitty for headbutting his client and vandalising his car at the station. While Vijay’s counsel argued his client could be granted bail, the prosecution objected, stating the actor had a history of assault and granting him bail would hamper the investigation as the actor could influence and intimidate witnesses.The court adjourned the bail plea hearing to Monday.
